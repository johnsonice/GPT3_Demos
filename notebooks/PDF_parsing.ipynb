      "NarrativeText  :  21. Contending with these wage and price pressures will require a rapid withdrawal of monetary accommodation. Given the broad-based nature of wage and price inflation, a range of model simulations indicate that quickly bringing inflation back to 2 percent requires an increase in the ex-ante real policy rate to above neutral (Box 4). There is also some evidence to suggest that a secular increase in market concentration among U.S. corporates may dampen the transmission of monetary tightening, requiring a more decisive cooling of labor markets to stabilize the system (Box\n",

      "NarrativeText  :  5). Staff’s baseline forecast is predicated on the median projection for the federal funds rate published at the June FOMC meeting. That rate path would push the ex ante real policy rate above zero by late-2022 and is expected to bring inflation back to 2 percent by late 2023/early 2024. However, if there is more inertia in wage and price inflation than is currently envisaged, a tighter policy stance will be needed to bring inflation back to target. This would lead to a more pronounced increase in unemployment and a short recession (Figure 1).\n",
      "NarrativeText  :  22. In addition to adopting a more front-loaded rate path, the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet should be quickly pared back (as was communicated in the May FOMC meeting). However, the empirical evidence suggests that balance sheet run-off is likely to have a relatively small impact on monetary conditions (Box 6). As such, changes in the federal funds rate will need to continue to be the primary tool for policy.\n",
      "NarrativeText  :  23. The effective communication of policy intentions will help keep medium-term inflation expectations anchored and bring inflation back to target. To strengthen the communications toolkit, the Federal Reserve could begin publishing, at each policy meeting, an internally-consistent economic projection and rate path—produced by Fed staff and potentially endorsed (or otherwise recognized) by the FOMC. This central forecast should be supplemented with a few alternate, quantified scenarios to show the range of views on the FOMC and the distribution of risks around the baseline. This would be preferable to the current reliance on the quarterly Summary of Economic Projections to convey FOMC members’ policy expectations. Putting in place such a communications device would help ensure that policymakers’ expectations about the likely future path for the policy rate are clearly conveyed and, in so doing, would strengthen the impact of forward guidance. The Federal Reserve could also usefully clarify in its Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy how the policy framework applies in an environment where inflation has moved well above two percent.\n",
      "NarrativeText  :  24. Bringing down inflation poses important macro and financial stability risks. Coupled with the pullback of fiscal stimulus, the envisioned withdrawal of monetary accommodation will further tighten financial conditions and restrain demand. A clear communication of policy intentions—particularly by the Federal Reserve—will help reduce the possibility that this shift in financial conditions is abrupt or disruptive. However, even with effective communications, a smooth transition back to lower inflation is by no means assured. Monetary policy will have to contend with a complex transmission of policy to financial and macroeconomic outcomes, including through the nonbanks (Box 7). Policymakers also face significant ongoing uncertainties related to the pandemic, China lockdowns, and the Russian invasion of Ukraine. This means there is a material chance that the needed shift in monetary policy will trigger a contraction in activity and a sizable increase in unemployment. Such a scenario would evidently have important negative outward spillovers—both through a drop in U.S. demand and a tightening of global financial conditions—that could side- swipe countries, individuals and firms that are leveraged in U.S. dollars and/or that face sizable near- term funding needs.\n",

There is also clarity about the strong commitment and determination of policymakers to restore price stability. Given the high degree of uncertainty in the pace and timing of disinflation, the Federal Reserve is being data dependent and is following an approach that involves expediting the return of the policy rate to neutral or modestly restrictive settings and then assessing, later this year, the effects of these policy changes and whether or not further policy adjustments are then required. The plan to reduce the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet is underway and will help firm the stance of monetary policy. The Federal Reserve considers its existing suite of communication tools—including the FOMC statement, press conferences after each meeting, the Summary of Economic Projections, minutes of FOMC meetings, and periodic speeches by senior officials—as being well understood by market participants and effective in aligning market expectations of the policy outlook with the FOMC’s own assessment.\n",

If such systemic vulnerabilities in market functioning were to materialize, the Federal Reserve would face a tricky dilemma in deciding whether or not to inject liquidity to restore market functioning at the same time as interest rates are moving higher to contain inflation. The introduction of standing facilities for primary dealers and foreign and international monetary authorities should help mitigate potential volatility in short-term interest rates but more needs to be done (including to reduce the possible stigma associated with the use of these facilities). Future changes that should be considered include the introduction of central clearing for the Treasury market, modifying the design of the supplementary leverage ratio (to allow for an increase in dealer intermediation capacity), moving all money market funds to a floating net asset value, considering more binding (and possibly countercyclical) liquid asset requirements, subjecting asset management vehicles to an annual liquidity stress test, instituting pre-determined arrangements to lock-in a proportion of an investor’s shares in the event of unusual outflows, providing for in-kind redemptions to meet withdrawals by institutional investors, and allowing for swing pricing or temporary gates on outflows.\n",

At the same time, the overall size and flows through key markets have grown significantly and are increasingly influenced by the activities of automated trading strategies. During the course of 2022, measures of liquidity and market depth in many markets have declined—notably in the Treasury market. On the whole, U.S. markets have functioned well in 2022. Furthermore, work is underway in hedge funds, open-ended mutual funds, and Treasury and related markets to close data gaps and increase the resilience-under-stress of these entities and markets.\n",

      "NarrativeText  :  The empirical literature offers limited evidence on the wage and price feedback loop. At the macro level, the link between labor cost and price inflation has been declining over the past three decades.1 Analysis using disaggregated data has, however, been relatively scant. Rissman2 finds a weak passthrough of wages to inflation and only in the manufacturing and retail sectors. Heise et al.3 find some evidence of passthrough from wage growth to producer price inflation in the services sector (but do not examine whether this translates also to retail price inflation).\n",
      "NarrativeText  :  Sectoral data suggests the acceleration of nominal wages has likely added only modestly to services inflation. Input-output matrices were used to construct industry wage costs across 73 sectors and these were matched with the same sectoral prices from the personal consumption expenditure index. Following the empirical strategy in Heise et al. (2021), panel estimates were then used to estimate the impact of wages on consumer prices (controlling for sectoral productivity growth and incorporating time and industry fixed effects). The results suggest that the passthrough from higher wages to services inflation is only around 13 percent after five quarters and there is no material passthrough to goods inflation. Restricting the sample to the post-COVID period suggests, if anything, that the passthrough to services has been smaller over the past two years than the historic average.\n"
