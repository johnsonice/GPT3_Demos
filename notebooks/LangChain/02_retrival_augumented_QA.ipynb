       "  Document(page_content='Asia: Developments in China continue to dominate the outlook for Asia, especially for emerging Asia. As noted, the combination of more transmissible variants and the strict zero-COVID strategy in China has led to repeated mobility restrictions and localized lockdowns that, together with an anemic recovery in urban employment, have weighed on private consumption. Recent lockdowns in key manufacturing and trading hubs such as Shenzhen and Shanghai will likely compound supply disruptions elsewhere in the region and beyond. Moreover, real estate\\ninvestment growth has slowed significantly. External demand is also expected to be weaker in light of the war in Ukraine. While partially offset by more supportive macroeconomic policy, these factors contribute to a\\n0.4 percentage point forecast downgrade for 2022. For the region more broadly, limited direct trade links to Russia and Ukraine mean that spillover effects will be limited\\nto the commodity price channel and to indirect impacts via weaker demand from key trading partners, such as the euro area. As such, external positions are generally\\nexpected to deteriorate—particularly for net oil importers. Notable downgrades to the 2022 forecast include Japan (0.9 percentage point) and India (0.8 percentage point), reflecting in part weaker domestic demand—as higher oil prices are expected to weigh on private consumption and investment—and a drag from lower net exports.', lookup_str='', metadata={'source': '/data/chuang/QA_LangChan/Knowledge_Base/2022_WEO_April_0.txt'}, lookup_index=0)]}"

Inflation is expected to remain elevated for longer than previously forecast, driven by war-induced commodity price increases and broadening price pressures. The projected inflation rates for 2022 are 5.7 percent in advanced economies and 8.7 percent in emerging market and developing economies, which are higher than projected in January. The forecast is subject to uncertainty, and worsening supply-demand imbalances and further increases in commodity prices could lead to persistently high inflation, rising inflation expectations, and strong downside risks to the global outlook.

      "Refined answer: The 2022 World Economic Outlook (WEO) macro-economic forecast predicts a significant worsening of global economic prospects since the last forecast in January, largely due to Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The war will severely set back the global recovery, slowing growth and increasing inflation even further. The forecast projects global growth at 3.6 percent in 2022 and 2023, which is 0.8 and 0.2 percentage points lower than in the January forecast, respectively. The downgrade largely reflects the war's direct impacts on Russia and Ukraine and global spillovers. Both Russia and Ukraine are projected to experience large GDP contractions in 2022. The severe collapse in Ukraine is a direct result of the invasion, destruction of infrastructure, and exodus of its people. In addition to the war, frequent and wider-ranging lockdowns in China, including in key manufacturing hubs, have also slowed activity there and could cause new bottlenecks in global supply chains. The forecast is highly uncertain, with downside risks dominating, including a possible worsening of the war, escalation of sanctions on Russia, a sharper-than-anticipated deceleration in China due to Omicron, and a renewed flare-up of the pandemic. Inflation is expected to remain elevated for longer than previously forecast, driven by war-induced commodity price increases and broadening price pressures. The projected inflation rates for 2022 are 5.7 percent in advanced economies and 8.7 percent in emerging market and developing economies, which are higher than projected in January. The forecast is subject to uncertainty, and worsening supply-demand imbalances and further increases in commodity prices could lead to persistently high inflation, rising inflation expectations, and strong downside risks to the global outlook.

      "The new context provides additional information on the risks faced by the banking sector in emerging markets, particularly related to their holdings of domestic sovereign debt. According to the 2022 Global Financial Stability Report and the IPCC Sixth Assessment Report, emerging market banks have significantly increased their holdings of domestic sovereign debt during the COVID-19 pandemic, which on average accounts for about one-fifth of banking sector assets and 200 percent of their regulatory capital. This deepens the ties between the sovereign and banking sectors, creating a sovereign-bank nexus that poses risks of an adverse feedback loop that could threaten macro-financial stability. The transmission of risks between the sovereign and banking sectors is significant, both directly and indirectly through the nonfinancial corporate sector. An increase in sovereign risk can adversely affect banks' balance sheets and lending appetite, especially in countries with less-well-capitalized banking systems and higher fiscal vulnerabilities. Therefore, emerging markets face complex policy trade-offs, and the policy response to mitigate risks must be tailored to country-specific circumstances. The 2022 Global Financial Stability Report highlights the risks faced by the banking sector in emerging markets, including nonperforming loans and the sustainability of corporate debt. However, it does not provide any specific information on the WEO assessment on banking sector risks. Sources: IPCC Sixth Assessment Report, 2022 Global Financial Stability Report, and Brookings Tech Stream.\n"
