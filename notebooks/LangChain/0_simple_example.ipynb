Juliet is upset and begs Romeo to stay, but he insists that he must leave. They share a passionate kiss before Romeo departs. Later in Act 5, Scene 1, Romeo receives news that Juliet has died and decides to return to Verona to be with her. He goes to an apothecary to buy poison and says, \"Well, Juliet, I will lie with thee tonight\" (Act 5, Scene 1, lines 34-35). This indicates that Romeo plans to take the poison and join Juliet in death. Overall, the text suggests that Romeo and Juliet have spent the night together before their tragic end.\n"
