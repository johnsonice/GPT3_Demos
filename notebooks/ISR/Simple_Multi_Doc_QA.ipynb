In response to the spike of\\n\\nenergy prices, the federal and regional authorities provided timely and substantial support to\\n\\nhouseholds and firms. Along with automatic indexation of wages and benefits, energy support\\n\\nhelped cushion impacts, although at significant cost, increasing the fiscal deficit in 2022 and\\n\\n2023. The labor market has remained tight, with record-high job creation and low\\n\\nunemployment. The external current account swung to a large deficit in 2022, due largely to\\n\\nhigher energy imports and lower vaccine exports. A resilient financial sector is facing\\n\\nchallenges from the weaker macro-financial environment. Some important structural reforms\\n\\ntook place in 2022.\\n\\nGrowth is expected to slow from 3.0 percent in 2022 to 0.2 percent in 2023, before returning to\\n\\npotential of 1.2 percent over the medium term. Inflation should decelerate from 10.3 percent in\\n\\n2022 to 5.5 percent in 2023, as energy prices ease. Indexation has opened a wage gap with\\n\\nkey trading partners, posing challenges for competitiveness. With aging and social-benefit\\n\\npressures and in the absence of adjustment measures, the structural fiscal deficit is expected\\n\\nto remain elevated over the medium term at 5½ percent of GDP and high public debt will also\\n\\nrise to about 120 percent of GDP in 2028, increasing vulnerabilities. Risks are tilted to the\\n\\ndownside, related to escalation of the war in Ukraine and a sharper-than-expected tightening\\n\\nof financial conditions. Lower energy prices would reduce fiscal pressures, and with progress\\n\\non structural reforms before elections in 2024, boost confidence.\\n\\n1 Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board.\\n\\nPR23/54\\n\\n2\\n\\nExecutive Board Assessment2\\n\\nExecutive Directors broadly agreed with the thrust of the staff appraisal. They welcomed the\\n\\nauthorities’ timely policy response, which helped cushion the impact of the energy crisis on\\n\\nhousehold and firms and strengthened energy security, but also led to fiscal deterioration and\\n\\nan erosion of competitiveness. Noting the economic slowdown this year and elevated\\n\\nuncertainty and downside risks, Directors called for prudent policies to preserve fiscal\\n\\nsustainability and financial stability and for structural reforms to boost competitiveness and\\n\\nreinvigorate growth.\\n\\nDirectors recommended a credible and ambitious multi-year, expenditure-led fiscal\\n\\nadjustment, drawing on spending reviews, to put debt on a declining path, replenish buffers,\\n\\nand complement monetary policy in curbing inflation. They encouraged the authorities to\\n\\nrationalize current spending while increasing productive public investment. Directors\\n\\nemphasized that energy support measures should remain limited and temporary, be better\\n\\ntargeted, and maintain price signals. They also encouraged improved coordination of\\n\\nspending across government levels and welcomed efforts to initiate tax reforms and enhance\\n\\npublic investment management.\\n\\nDirectors concurred that financial sector policies should continue to balance ensuring\\n\\nadequate credit provision, preserving resilience, and facilitating deployment of buffers to\\n\\nabsorb losses when needed. Given rising interest rates and the slowing economy and housing\\n\\nmarket, they called for close monitoring of financial stability risks. While most Directors\\n\\nsupported the authorities’ near-term hold on additional macroprudential policy tightening,\\n\\nsome Directors considered that further tightening could be desirable to continue strengthening\\n\\nresilience, as long as macro-financial conditions allow. Directors welcomed recent steps to\\n\\nfurther strengthen the AML/CFT framework and looked forward to the conclusions of the\\n\\nongoing FSAP.\\n\\nDirectors emphasized that further labor and product market reforms are key to improve\\n\\nproductivity and competitiveness and reinvigorate growth. They recommended additional\\n\\nmeasures to facilitate labor reallocation, including enhancing labor market flexibility and\\n\\nincentive setting in the social security and pension systems. Directors noted that pension\\n\\nreforms are critical for Belgium to receive the Next Generation EU funds. They also\\n\\nencouraged the authorities to consider revising the wage indexation framework once\\n\\ninflationary pressures subside. They welcomed efforts to improve the business environment,\\n\\nincluding reforms to the restructuring and insolvency frameworks and actions to strengthen\\n\\ncyber risk monitoring and preparedness.\\n\\n2 At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings-up can be found here: http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.\\n\\n3\\n\\nDirectors agreed that reaching ambitious climate goals require a wider set of initiatives and\\n\\ngreater focus on coordination and execution, including aligning national climate policies with\\n\\nmore ambitious EU targets and considering raising carbon pricing. They welcomed the\\n\\nsignificant new investments in renewables to enhance energy security.\\n\\nIt is expected that the next Article IV consultation with Belgium will be held on the standard 12-month cycle.\\n\\n4\\n\\nTable 1.

In response to the spike of energy prices, the federal and regional authorities provided timely and substantial support to households and firms. Along with automatic indexation of wages and benefits, energy support helped cushion impacts, although at significant cost, increasing the fiscal deficit in 2022 and 2023. The labor market has remained tight, with record-high job creation and low unemployment. The external current account swung to a large deficit in 2022, due largely to higher energy imports and lower vaccine exports. Energy consumption is being cut, and gas imports reoriented. A resilient financial sector is facing challenges from the weaker macro-financial environment.\\n\\nOutlook/risks: Growth is expected to slow from 3.0 percent in 2022 to 0.2 percent in 2023, returning to 1.2 percent (potential) over the medium term. Inflation should decelerate from 10.3 percent in 2022 to 5.5 percent in 2023, as energy prices ease. Indexation has opened a wage gap with key trading partners, posing challenges for competitiveness. Without measures, the already-high fiscal deficit—4.8 pct of GDP in 2022—will increase further with aging costs adding 0.2-0.3 ppt. per year; high public debt (106.8 percent of GDP) will also rise, increasing vulnerabilities. Risks are tilted to the downside, related to escalation of the war in Ukraine and a sharper-than-expected tightening of financial conditions. Lower energy prices would reduce fiscal pressures, and with progress on structural reforms before elections in 2024, boost confidence.\\n\\nPolicies: The authorities should pursue multi-year, expenditure-led fiscal consolidation from 2023 to support efforts to reduce inflation, ease financing pressures and vulnerabilities, rebuild buffers, make room for increased public investment, and put debt on a declining path. They should improve targeting of energy support and advance reforms in social benefits, pensions, and health in the window before elections. Efforts to initiate tax reforms are welcome, along with growth-enhancing measures (labor and product markets, business environment) to help meet ambitious employment goals. More progress is needed. Financial sector policies should balance ensuring the adequate provision of credit, preserving resilience, and facilitating deployment of buffers to absorb losses when needed. Climate actions should be advanced to meet new, more ambitious emissions-reduction targets. In all these areas, better alignment of federal and regional planning and policies will be helpful. While the financial sector has performed well, risks are rising, and vigilance is warranted.\\n\\nBELGIUM\\n\\nApproved by: Laura Papi (EUR) and Maria Gonzalez (SPR)\\n\\nDiscussions took place in Brussels during December 7–21, 2022.

Spillovers from Russia’s war in Ukraine have weakened a strong, private consumption-led, post-pandemic recovery. Direct exposures to Russia and Ukraine via trade, energy, and financial channels are limited, but growth has slowed due to elevated uncertainty and spillovers from key trading partners more directly affected by the conflict. Price pressures and tighter financial conditions have also weighed on households and firms, undermining confidence and activity. Widespread indexation of wages and social benefits and substantial and timely fiscal support for higher energy bills have shielded household incomes; easing supply bottlenecks have supported output.1\\n\\nEconomic Developments\\n\\nReal GDP Level (Index, 2019Q4 = 100)\\n\\nReal GDP Growth (Annual percentage change)\\n\\nConfidence Indicators (Percentage point balance)\\n\\n120\\n\\n115\\n\\n110\\n\\n105\\n\\n100\\n\\nBelgium France Germany Netherlands\\n\\nNet exports Investment Public cons.

Inflation has risen sharply, with pressures broadening from energy to core categories. Energy has accounted for two-fifths of inflation, 10.2 percent y/y in December, down from a peak of 12.3 percent in October. Core inflation (5.5 percent y/y, close to the euro-area average) has accelerated as price pressures have spilled into services and non-energy industrial goods, reflecting robust post-pandemic demand and the ability of firms so far to pass on higher wages and energy cost pressures to consumers. Nearly nine-tenths of household consumption items are registering inflation above 2 percent.\\n\\n1 See Annex I for a review of implementation of past recommendations.\\n\\n4\\n\\nINTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND\\n\\n2 2 - n a J\\n\\nBELGIUM\\n\\nInflation Developments\\n\\nHICP Inflation (Annual percentage changes, percentage point contributions)\\n\\nInflation Dispersion 1/ (Percent)\\n\\n14\\n\\n12\\n\\n10\\n\\n8\\n\\n6\\n\\n4\\n\\nProcessed food, alcohol, tobacco Non-energy industrial goods Services Unprocessed food Energy Headline inflation Smoothed health index\\n\\n100 90 80 70 60 50 40 30 20 10 0\\n\\n2\\n\\n0\\n\\n8 1 0 2 - n a J\\n\\n8 1 0 2 - n u J\\n\\n8 1 0 2 - v o N\\n\\n9 1 0 2 - r p A\\n\\n9 1 0 2 - p e S\\n\\n0 2 0 2 - b e F\\n\\n0 2 0 2 - l u J\\n\\n0 2 0 2 - c e D\\n\\n1 2 0 2 - y a M\\n\\n1 2 0 2 - t c O\\n\\n2 2 0 2 - r a M\\n\\n2 2 0 2 - g u A\\n\\n2\\n\\n<-1.5\\n\\n[-1.5, -0.5)\\n\\n[-0.5, 0)\\n\\n[0, 0.5)\\n\\n[0.5, 1)\\n\\n[1, 1.5)\\n\\n4\\n\\n[1.5, 2)\\n\\n[2, 2.5)\\n\\n[2.5, 5)\\n\\n[5, 10)\\n\\n[10, 20)\\n\\n>=20\\n\\nJan-14 Jan-15 Jan-16 Jan-17 Jan-18 Jan-19 Jan-20 Jan-21 Jan-22\\n\\nSources: StatBel and IMF staff calculations\\n\\n1/ Share of consumption basket within each inflation band. Sources: StatBel and IMF staff calculations.\\n\\n3. Fiscal support to households and firms during the pandemic and the energy price shock have helped mitigate impacts, but eroded buffers. The 2022 overall deficit remained high—4.8 percent of GDP versus 5.6 percent in 2021—and widened by 0.4 ppt. compared with pre-war forecasts. This reflected energy-price measures (1.0 percent) and refugee support (0.2 percent), partly offset by higher revenues. Energy support measures include expanded social tariffs and gas and electricity vouchers for lower- and middle-income households in the winter months. Some measures, such as reduction of the VAT rate on gas and electricity from 21 to 6 percent and lowering of excise duties for petrol and diesel, were not targeted and did not maintain price signals to reduce consumption. Measures are subject to quarter-by-quarter review; most are now set to expire at end-Q1:2023. This coincides well with the recent decline in natural gas prices.

Despite the elevated deficit, high inflation helped ease the debt ratio in 2022 (from 109.2 percent to 106.8 percent of GDP), but debt remains well above pre-pandemic levels (97.6 percent of GDP in 2019). The authorities used the long period of low interest rates to extend maturities and reduce debt-service costs. With financial tightening, government bond yields have\\n\\nINTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND\\n\\n5\\n\\nBELGIUM\\n\\npicked up to levels prevailing before the ECB’s launch of public-sector bond-purchase programs in 2014, although spreads have so far remained contained.\\n\\nCredit Developments\\n\\nPrivate Sector Lending (Annual percent change)\\n\\n10\\n\\n8\\n\\nTotal NFCs Households\\n\\nPrivate and Public Sector Credit Conditions (LHS: Percent; RHS: Net percentage balance) 8\\n\\n7\\n\\n6\\n\\nNew housing loans, interest rate (lhs) New small NFC loans, interest rate (lhs) 10-year government bond yield (lhs) Housing loans, credit standards (rhs) SME loans, credit standards (rhs)\\n\\n6\\n\\n5\\n\\n4\\n\\n4\\n\\n3\\n\\n2\\n\\n2\\n\\n1\\n\\n0\\n\\n0\\n\\n1\\n\\n2\\n\\n2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022\\n\\n4 1 - n a J\\n\\n5 1 - n a J\\n\\n6 1 - n a J\\n\\n7 1 - n a J\\n\\n8 1 - n a J\\n\\n9 1 - n a J\\n\\n0 2 - n a J\\n\\n1 2 - n a J\\n\\n2 2 - n a J\\n\\nSources: NBB and IMF staff calculations.\\n\\nSources: NBB and ECB.\\n\\n5. Credit has continued to grow at a robust pace, although tightening financial conditions are heralding a slowdown. Mortgage lending (+5.7 percent y/y in November) has stabilized at an elevated level, supported by ongoing, albeit flagging, strength in house prices. Borrowing by non-financial corporations (NFCs) continued its rebound (+6.1 percent y/y). However, the latest available bank lending surveys indicate a slowing of housing and corporate credit demand, as interest rates have markedly risen from historic lows, and banks have tightened credit standards, reflecting growing concerns about the outlook and risk.\\n\\n6. The financial sector has emerged resilient from the pandemic, although systemic risks are rising due to tightening financial conditions and the worsening economic environment. Profitability has returned to pre-pandemic levels, as pandemic-related NPLs and bankruptcies did not materialize, further bolstering elevated capital ratios. Still, Russia’s war in Ukraine and the energy crisis have raised sectoral credit and cyber risk concerns, prompting banks to strengthen loan-loss provisioning. House prices did not rise as markedly as in other euro-area (EA) countries but there are signs of overvaluation and the market has started to cool. Commercial properties remain supported by a stable tenant structure in the dominant Brussels office segment and by sustained demand in logistics. Non-bank financial institutions have shown little sign of stress. Occupational pension funds account for a relatively small part of financial-sector assets, and liquidity pressures from derivatives exposures appear contained. With a sizeable part of the insurance sector being part of larger financial groups, the hedging of interest-rate risk is often with the group’s banking arm, limiting spillover risks; investment funds appear little leveraged.\\n\\n6\\n\\nINTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND\\n\\n3 2 - n a J\\n\\n100\\n\\n75\\n\\n50\\n\\n25\\n\\n0\\n\\n25\\n\\n50\\n\\n75\\n\\n100\\n\\nBELGIUM\\n\\nFinancial Sector Developments\\n\\nBank Profitability and Capital Adequacy (LHS: Percent; RHS: basis points)\\n\\nBank Asset Quality (LHS: EUR bn; RHS: Percent)\\n\\n30\\n\\n25\\n\\n20\\n\\n15\\n\\nCET1 capital ratio (lhs) Return on equity (lhs) Net interest margin (rhs)\\n\\n200\\n\\n175\\n\\n150\\n\\n2.0\\n\\n1.5\\n\\nWritedowns and provisions\\n\\nNPL ratio\\n\\n5.0\\n\\n4.0\\n\\n3.0\\n\\n125\\n\\n1.0\\n\\n10\\n\\n2.0\\n\\n5\\n\\n0\\n\\n100\\n\\n75\\n\\n0.5\\n\\n1.0\\n\\n5\\n\\n4 1 - r a M\\n\\n5 1 - r a M\\n\\n6 1 - r a M\\n\\n7 1 - r a M\\n\\n8 1 - r a M\\n\\n9 1 - r a M\\n\\n0 2 - r a M\\n\\n1 2 - r a M\\n\\n2 2 - r a M\\n\\n50\\n\\n0.0\\n\\n4 1 - r a M\\n\\n5 1 - r a M\\n\\n6 1 - r a M\\n\\n7 1 - r a M\\n\\n8 1 - r a M\\n\\n9 1 - r a M\\n\\n0 2 - r a M\\n\\n1 2 - r a M\\n\\n2 2 - r a M\\n\\n0.0\\n\\nSource: EBA.\\n\\nSources: NBB and EBA.\\n\\n7.

Belgium: Characteristics and Challenges of Belgium’s Wage Indexation Framework\\n\\nWage formation is characterized by the desire to shield households from purchasing-power losses while protecting the competitiveness of a highly open economy. The wage-setting process was codified into a Wage Law in 1996, obliging employers and trade unions to negotiate salary increases for the coming two years within the bounds of a ceiling determined by projected hourly wage developments in key export markets and a floor determined by projected inflation in Belgium. Wages are indexed to actual inflation by means of a “health index”, a basket of prices excluding alcohol, tobacco, and petrol. Wage indexation is triggered once the health index passes a 2-percent threshold, immediately for about half of private sector employees and, with a two-month delay, for all public sector workers. For the remainder, wage indexation takes effect at intervals of up to 12 months, reflecting historical patterns of sales price indexation by firms that are generally no longer in force. If actual inflation in Belgium, and, by extension, wage indexation, surpasses projected inflation and projected wage growth in key competitors, a positive wage gap emerges. In such an event, the Wage Law stipulates its reduction over time, possibly necessitating a long period of real wage restraint, politically sensitive and potentially weakening labor market efficiency.\\n\\nDespite successfully maintaining wage competitiveness in recent years, the current run-up in inflation may put the wage setting framework under considerable strain. While wage indexation largely protects the purchasing power of households, it redistributes the economic costs of a terms-of-trade shock like the current climb in commodity prices to firms and the government, thereby burdening public finances and corporate profitability or competitiveness. With the rapid acceleration of actual inflation, multiple rounds of wage indexation have taken place, far surpassing the projected domestic inflation and projected wage developments in key export markets that underpinned the last wage negotiation round in early 2021. Consequently, latest estimates by the authorities indicate the opening of a 2.9 percent wage gap at the end of 2022. As a result, space for real wage growth for the period 2022-24 is non-existent, as the Wage Law mandates real wage restraint until the wage gap is closed. To secure a deal between employers and trade unions, government intervention involving fiscal incentives was required, a common feature in recent wage negotiations rounds.\\n\\nAbsent abolition of wage indexation, several avenues of reform could improve the performance and viability of the current wage setting framework. In particular, the basis for indexation, the health index, should be reviewed. Specifically, the scope for excluding price increases in highly volatile components of the consumption basket, like energy or food, should be explored to prevent their quick pass-through to wages that will need to be offset by prolonged periods of real wage restraint if they do not get incorporated in equal measure into the wages of key export markets. Moreover, options to at least temporarily widen the flexibility of the indexation regime should be contemplated to alleviate the burden of firms at times of large and multiple shocks, thereby also preserving investment and employment. Finally, productivity trends should also be accounted for to capture deviations of labor costs between Belgium and its key export markets, rather than merely nominal wage costs.\\n\\n3 Belgium has adhered to the IMF’s Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS) Plus, the highest tier of the IMF’s Data Standards Initiatives, as of January 26, 2023 (see Press Release).\\n\\nINTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND\\n\\n9\\n\\nBELGIUM\\n\\nOUTLOOK AND RISKS\\n\\n10. Inflationary pressures, elevated uncertainty, and tighter financial conditions are weighing on confidence and activity. This is expected to lead to a shallow recession during winter 2022-23. A mild recovery is anticipated over the rest of 2023, yielding annual growth of 0.2 percent, mainly reflecting gains in household purchasing power from wage indexation and a pick-up of external demand. Inflation (core) is expected to reach 5.5 (6.3) percent in 2023, compared with 10.3 (4.0) percent in 2022. Growth should return to potential of 1.2 percent over the medium term, with a modest negative output gap (-0.2 percent in 2023) closing by 2026. With aging and social- benefit pressures, the structural fiscal deficit is expected to remain elevated over the medium term at 5½ percent of GDP, well above pre-pandemic (1.9 percent in 2019) and debt-stabilizing levels (2.3 percent).

The growth outlook is subject to significant uncertainty and downside risks, with upside risks for inflation (Annex III). Key risks stem from a prolonged war in Ukraine and an escalation of sanctions on Russia, with negative implications for growth and upward pressures on inflation.4 Given Belgium’s high share of energy-intensive industries (e.g., chemicals, metals), intensified energy-supply disruptions could depress output. Further energy price shocks could feed a wage-price spiral, and de-anchor inflation expectations. Tightening financial conditions could pressure private and public sector funding or lead to a sharper correction in real estate markets. An alternative risk to growth is from a global slowdown, for example, triggered by recession in the U.S. In either case, spillovers from affected trading partners would place an additional drag on growth in Belgium, even if a global slowdown might dampen inflationary pressures. Also, the energy crisis and the electoral calendar may impede progress on politically-sensitive fiscal consolidation and reforms. By contrast, lower energy prices could reduce fiscal pressures, and together with progress on structural reforms, boost confidence. Authorities’ Views\\n\\n8\\n\\n6\\n\\n4\\n\\n2\\n\\n0\\n\\n12.

An analysis of the global spillovers of sanctions can be found in the April 2022 IMF World Economic Outlook.

The authorities anticipate faster easing of price pressures, with the capability of firms to maintain profit margins and pass on cost increases as a key factor determining the inflation outlook. However, the authorities are also concerned that higher wage costs and persistently-higher energy prices could lead to a worsening of competitiveness for Belgian exporters, particularly vis-à-vis non-EU competitors that do not face as strong energy price pressures. Cost- conscious diversion of FDI away from Belgium is a concern, although they noted that Belgium remains an innovation hub. Finally, while the authorities see limited risk of financial market pressures, they agreed that these could originate elsewhere.\\n\\nPOLICY DISCUSSIONS\\n\\nA. Strengthening Fiscal Sustainability\\n\\n13. A tighter fiscal stance is needed in 2023 to support inflation reduction, diminish risks and vulnerabilities, and initiate rebuilding of buffers. The 2023-24 budgetary plan envisages a higher deficit in 2023, including due to energy support. Notwithstanding continuing high energy prices and slower growth, commencing adjustment this year and committing to a credible, multi-year adjustment path anchored by both cyclical and sustainability considerations would ease inflation pressures and have positive impacts on confidence, risk premia, and fiscal space. This calls for adjustment of 0.6 percent of GDP (or more) for 2023 and 0.8 percent of GDP per year (or more) for 2024-30. The overall deficit in 2023 should not increase, and ideally, should be reduced. 5 Energy support should remain within the budgeted allocation of 0.9 percent of GDP (or lower); measures set to expire at end-Q1:2023 should not be extended without offsetting measures.6 If downside risks materialize with entrenched stagflation, automatic stabilizers should operate, but be offset elsewhere, so that the overall deficit does not increase; additional discretionary support, if any, should be well-targeted and offset. This would enhance policy credibility, sustainability, and consistency with monetary policy. Tighter financing conditions would call for a more sizable adjustment. If global growth slows with less inflationary pressure, stabilizers might operate without full offset, although some offset may be desirable or necessary given risks from the high deficit and debt. If upside risks materialize, revenue overperformance should be saved and energy support phased out faster to speed up the needed adjustment. 5 Staff’s baseline projections for 2023 assume that higher revenue collections more than offset higher expenditures compared to the budgetary plan; include VAT cuts on energy products for the whole year (0.3 percent of GDP beyond Q1:2023); and do not incorporate possible new excise taxes.\\n\\n6 The net cost of energy measures budgeted for 2023 covering Q1:2023 amounted to 0.9 percent of GDP (compared to 1 percent of GDP for 2022) as they include basic energy package for low-middle income households (0.3 percent of GDP) and new regional governments’ measures largely for businesses (0.2 percent of GDP).\\n\\nINTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 11\\n\\nBELGIUM\\n\\nFiscal Overview\\n\\nOverview of Fiscal Positions 1/ (Percent of GDP) Budgetary Plan 2023 2023 49.9 55.7 1.7 -5.8 -4.2 -4.9 … -3.2 108.2\\n\\n2022 48.4 53.6 1.5 -5.2 -3.8 -4.9 … -3.4 105.3\\n\\nRevenue Expenditure\\n\\no/w Interest\\n\\nNet lending/borrowing Primary balance Structural balance\\n\\n(excl.

Fiscal adjustment should continue over the medium term. With deficits projected to remain high due to aging-related expenditures, higher defense outlays, and increasing debt service costs, the debt ratio will rise, along with vulnerabilities to adverse changes in market sentiment. These could emanate elsewhere, with Belgium as a bystander. High deficits and debt limit space to respond to new shocks and constrain increases in capital investment needed to support growth and green transition. Further annual adjustments of 0.8 percent of GDP (or more) from next year would ensure that the debt-stabilizing deficit level is reached in 2026 and structural balance attained in 2030 (Annex IV).7,8 Fiscal consolidation, together with structural reforms, would also help strengthen Belgium’s external position, helping bring it in line with fundamentals and desirable policies.

Fiscal adjustment should focus on spending, while preserving and increasing investment outlays to mitigate near-term growth impacts and support medium-term growth. General government spending is elevated at 56 percent of GDP in 2023, particularly social outlays\\n\\n7 The structural balance includes some Covid-19, energy, and Ukraine crisis measures not considered one-offs (e.g., health spending increases on wages and other qualitative improvements in health-sector working conditions).\\n\\n8 See Annex V for a discussion of debt sustainability.\\n\\n12\\n\\nINTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND\\n\\nBELGIUM\\n\\n(27 percent of GDP), the wage bill (13 percent of GDP), and subsidies (4 percent of GDP), with substantial scope for efficiency gains. Tax rates are high, affecting compliance and growth.\\n\\nRationalization. Adjustment should draw on recent spending reviews9, with focus on enhancing\\n\\nefficiencies, especially in energy-support measures, goods and services, and subsidies, along with reducing federal-regional duplication. Beyond 2023, further efforts will be needed in these areas, along with measures to contain wage-bill, social-benefit, and aging (pensions, health) costs. Social benefits should be better targeted (especially unemployment, disability), with a focus on improving incentives for job search. The authorities have identified targets for health-system savings in 2023 and 2024 and intend to reduce real health spending growth from 2.5 to 2.0 percent in 2024.\\n\\n\\n\\nInvestment. Public investment has increased in recent years, but remains relatively low, constraining productivity and growth (e.g., mobility bottlenecks). The authorities rightly aim to increase investment outlays from 2.7 percent of GDP to 4 percent of GDP by 2030, initially via Next Generation EU (NGEU) grants. There is scope to improve the public investment management framework at the federal and regional levels, with support from an IMF diagnostic assessment (PIMA).10\\n\\n16. Energy support should be better targeted and remain temporary and limited. Support is relatively large among EU countries, especially given wage and benefit indexation in Belgium, and there are risks of measures becoming protracted if high prices continue (Annex VI). The authorities should communicate that support will not exceed the budgeted amount of 0.9 percent of GDP in 2023, and will be scaled back from 2024 (or earlier, if possible). Social tariffs with enhanced targeting are expected to remain. Support has been somewhat targeted, including a claw-back mechanism for higher-income earners. However, design should be enhanced by better targeting to account for purchasing-power protection via indexation and for energy exposure, in addition to income. Support should be provided in cash transfers to incentivize energy savings, and social tariff benefits should not involve employment disincentives via full phase-out with changes of job status, but instead a tapering mechanism that allows for some increase of income above eligibility thresholds. The reduction of the VAT rate on gas and electricity for households from 21 to 6 percent is expected to become permanent, with a shift to specific excises that will incorporate progressivity elements and be adjusted for sharp changes in prices. Excise rates are expected to be set to promote a shift from fossil fuels to clean electricity. The excises should also be indexed and incorporate an upward path that promotes emissions reduction. Part of the costs of energy support is expected to be defrayed by windfall taxes on energy companies and oil sector solidarity contributions. While these have been 9 The federal government implemented three pilot spending reviews in each 2021 and 2022: withholding-tax transfer exemptions, health care effectiveness, teleworking, income-tax collection cooperation, nuclear decommissioning, and federal scientific-institution management. Additional reviews are planned in 2023. The regional governments are also conducting spending reviews.\\n\\n10 The authorities have made important use of IMF technical assistance advice, including in tax reform formulation and revenue administration (compliance enforcement, VAT gap analysis).\\n\\nINTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 13\\n\\nBELGIUM\\n\\ndesigned to apply to a prudent measure of extraordinary revenues, potential adverse impacts on investments in renewables should be closely monitored.\\n\\n17. Further efforts to advance tax and benefit reforms are key to sustained rebuilding of buffers and higher growth. Efforts are focusing on reducing the tax burden on labor and on tax expenditures, strengthening revenue administration, reducing disincentives to work, and shoring up pension sustainability. There is scope to enhance fiscal-federalism arrangements—improving planning, coordination, incentives, and outcomes.\\n\\nTax reform. A blueprint to modernize and simplify the tax system, while enhancing fairness and\\n\\nneutrality, was presented in July 2022, with commentary from the IMF. Implementation had been intended to start with the next legislature, but reforms may be launched in 2023. Measures would reduce the tax burden on labor, eliminate or reduce tax expenditures, and address work disincentives (via tax rates, brackets, and alignment with social benefits). Reforms should also make capital taxation more consistent across income sources. A second tax reform stream focuses on carbon pricing and emissions reduction. These are key reforms that should move forward. It will be important that robust compensating measures are secured, so that the reform is (at least) budget neutral.\\n\\nRevenue administration. The authorities are strengthening compliance and revenue mobilization\\n\\nthrough an anti-fraud plan that improves tools and coordination of tax, social security, employment, and law enforcement agencies. Greater access to third-party information would be helpful. The IMF will continue to provide support to estimating and closing the VAT collection gap, and the authorities have expressed interest in the IMF’s Tax Administration Diagnostic Assessment Tool (TADAT).11\\n\\nPensions. Reforms were agreed in July (effective 2024), including: (i) reintroduction of a three-\\n\\nyear pension bonus for working after the statutory retirement age of 65 (or early retirement at 62); (ii) re-setting minimum working conditions to 20 years of effective employment for access to minimum pensions; and (iii) a pension supplement to reduce the gender gap for periods of part- time work due to child or family care. These reforms addressed important gaps, but increased costs by 0.1 – 0.3 percent of GDP by 2070. Further efforts are needed now to ensure budget- neutral reforms—a key condition for NGEU funding—and over the medium term to reduce aging-related spending pressures.\\n\\nOther benefits. Recent expansions of social spending (minimum pensions, COVID-19 and energy support) have added to fiscal pressures. More generally, real benefit increases have exceeded productivity and wage growth. Unemployment benefits are generous, with high replacement rates relative to other EU countries, unlimited duration, and low phase-out. Favorable eligibility and duration of disability benefits also add to costs. The tight job market offers an opportunity to advance social benefit reforms and reduce inactivity traps, along with efforts to improve job- matching, training, coaching, mobility, and flexibility.\\n\\n11 The VAT gap was estimated in 2022 at 8 percent of GDP (22 percent of potential). Policy gaps comprise 6 ppts, half due to the large public sector, while compliance gaps comprise 2 ppts.\\n\\n14\\n\\nINTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND\\n\\nBELGIUM\\n\\n\\n\\nFiscal federalism. Federalism arrangements in Belgium involve substantial decentralization of fiscal competencies to regions and communities. Within this framework, there is scope to improve planning, policy alignment, savings incentives, and outcomes. This is particularly important given the need for fiscal consolidation—regional and community deficits comprise a third of the general government deficit. Implementing existing cooperation arrangements, agreed in 2013, would help strengthen policy alignment across different levels of government. Further options include implementing medium-term budgetary frameworks and expenditure rules at all levels, fully integrating comprehensive spending reviews and cost-benefit assessments and improving integration of fiscal sustainability objectives and burden sharing.12\\n\\nAuthorities’ Views\\n\\n18. The authorities agreed that fiscal adjustment is needed but cautioned that consolidation in 2023 should be balanced with energy support needs and slowing growth. If energy prices remain high, continued support will require a political decision, including on adjustment of measures and on budget mitigation. They also pointed to limited market pressures to date and uncertainty on new EU fiscal rules. They noted that adjustment will be considered during a budget review planned for March. They reiterated that energy measures are temporary and are considering ways to further improve targeting and incentives. They stressed that the new excises will be progressive and provide price signals for energy savings and the green transition. They appreciated staff’s recommendations for the adjustment to be shared with regions and communities, but noted challenges given assigned federal, regional, and community competencies, lack of federal- regional hierarchy, and a political landscape that limits consensus on coordination. B. Safeguarding Financial Stability\\n\\n19. Cooling of the housing market, which has been characterized by elevated prices, calls for heightened vigilance and release of buffers, if needed. Although valuations are not as stretched as elsewhere in Europe, model-based estimates point to some overvaluation.13 Bank mortgage exposures are relatively high, and debt-service-to-income ratios are somewhat elevated. Risks are mitigated by prevalence of mortgages with full-recourse provisions that amortize fully over the maturity of the loan and by a high share of fixed-rate and longer-term (>15 years) loans. A sectoral systemic risk buffer (SSyRB) against housing-related exposures introduced in May 202214 and tighter LTV limits imposed by prudential guidelines since 2020 provide additional comfort. Moreover, aggregate liquid assets of households exceed mortgage debt (Figure 3), potentially 12 See accompanying Selected Issues Paper: “Fiscal Federalism in Belgium: Challenges in Restoring Fiscal Sustainability.”\\n\\n13 For details on the methodology to estimate RRE valuations, see ECB (2011): “Tools for Detecting a Possible Misalignment of Residential Property Prices from Fundamentals”, Financial Stability Review, pp. 57-59, June, and ECB (2015): “A Model-Based Valuation Metric for Residential Property Markets”, Financial Stability Review, pp. 45-47, November.\\n\\n14 With EU-wide harmonization of macroprudential instruments via introduction of CRDV, a 9 percent SSyRB affecting the largest lenders replaced mortgage risk-weight add-ons in place since 2013, keeping the level of additional capital preserved at approximately €2 billion.\\n\\nINTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 15\\n\\nBELGIUM\\n\\ncushioning the impact of deteriorating income prospects on debt servicing capacity. Still, the recent slowdown of house-price momentum, potentially heralding a sharper market turn, deserves careful monitoring and SSyRB deployment, if needed. Despite limited use, strict eligibility criteria, and adequate provisioning, reactivating mortgage moratoria for October 2022-March 2023 to cushion energy-crisis impacts was inappropriate, as it may delay timely bank-borrower engagement to address debt-servicing challenges. NBB efforts to gather housing stock energy efficiency information to allow for better assessment of collateral values and risks are welcome and should continue, particularly given emerging stratification of house prices based on sustainability considerations.15\\n\\nHousing Market Valuation and Momentum\\n\\nHousing Valuations (LHS: index, 2015 = 100; RHS: percent over-/undervaluation)\\n\\nHousing Market Activity (Annual percentage changes)\\n\\n150\\n\\n25\\n\\n16\\n\\n130\\n\\nBelgium: price-to-rent ratio Euro area: price-to-rent ratio Belgium: price-to-income ratio Euro area: price-to-income ratio Model-based valuation (rhs)\\n\\n20\\n\\n15\\n\\n14\\n\\n12\\n\\n10\\n\\n8\\n\\nHouse price index\\n\\nPurchase of existing dwellings\\n\\nConstruction output prices\\n\\n6\\n\\n110\\n\\n10\\n\\n4\\n\\n2\\n\\n5\\n\\n0\\n\\n90\\n\\n4 1 - r a M\\n\\n5 1 - r a M\\n\\n6 1 - r a M\\n\\n7 1 - r a M\\n\\n8 1 - r a M\\n\\n9 1 - r a M\\n\\n0 2 - r a M\\n\\n1 2 - r a M\\n\\n2 2 - r a M\\n\\n0\\n\\n2\\n\\n4\\n\\n4 1 - r a M\\n\\n5 1 - r a M\\n\\n6 1 - r a M\\n\\n7 1 - r a M\\n\\n8 1 - r a M\\n\\n9 1 - r a M\\n\\n0 2 - r a M\\n\\n1 2 - r a M\\n\\nSources: OECD and ECB.\\n\\nSource: StatBel.\\n\\n20. The war in Ukraine and energy crisis have rekindled sectoral credit and cyber risk concerns, calling for a near-term halt to macroprudential tightening and enhanced operational preparedness. Banks command considerable buffers, and corporate credit risk appears manageable.16 NPLs have improved across most sectors since 2019, despite the pandemic. Still, cost pressures are affecting businesses that were most affected by the pandemic (hospitality, entertainment), and dampening the outlook for firms that account for a prominent share of lending (e.g., manufacturing, trade). Combined with a possible downturn in real estate, asset quality could deteriorate, requiring additional provisioning. In this context, maintaining the CCyB at its 0 percent neutral level until uncertainty on the outlook subsides is appropriate. Going forward, further weakening of the macro-financial environment may call for calibration of macroprudential policy towards supporting capacity of banks to absorb losses and safeguarding provision of credit. Challenges from digitalization have been put into sharper relief due to the war in Ukraine and increasing risk of cyberattacks. Gathering of information on cyber-preparedness is welcome, along with tailored stress-testing and policy intervention to mitigate risks. Heightened awareness of 15 See Damen, S., Reusens, P. and F.

Higher and steeper yield curves should benefit financial intermediaries, but may also expose vulnerabilities, calling for intensified monitoring and determined policy action. Exiting the low-for-long interest-rate environment should improve interest margins and better balance assets of NBFIs, e.g., life insurers, against long-term liabilities. But a disorderly adjustment of yields, accompanied by market volatility or a downturn, could negate interest-rate normalization benefits. The big foreign bank presence adds to complexity, due to the interplay of home and host supervision. Efforts to better understand NBFI interlinkages and risks are welcome to detect vulnerabilities and contain spillovers at an early stage, as is the commitment by the authorities to advance the EU banking union. In addition, dedicated analysis and simulation of various interest-rate trajectories would help gauge potential financial-sector strains and inform the appropriateness of buffers and deployment of policy levers. Similar work should be conducted to assess possible implication of climate risks. The ongoing FSAP provides an opportunity for an in-depth review of financial sector vulnerabilities and resilience.17 Authorities’ Views\\n\\n22. The authorities shared staff’s assessment of financial stability risks, demonstrating alertness to emerging challenges and readiness to take appropriate policy actions. They consider the near-term halt to macroprudential tightening to be a suitable stance in the current environment, while indicating willingness to contemplate further strengthening of buffers once greater clarity on the macro-financial outlook is attained. Overall, they were comfortable with the resilience of the financial sector and the housing market, yet agreed with staff’s views on potential vulnerabilities, signaling readiness to release available buffers should risks materialize. They are working to improve their appraisal of NBFI-related risks and to strengthen AML/CFT measures of financial institutions. They also expressed strong commitment to fully leveraging opportunities presented by the IMF FSAP launched in November 2022 to enhance financial sector resilience. C. Building a Stronger and More Sustainable Economy\\n\\n23. Recent labor market reforms have covered important gaps, but further measures are needed to facilitate reallocation and ambitious employment goals. A new federal labor package became effective in 2022 focusing on: (i) flexibility (e.g., easier e-commerce night-work, enhanced status for platform workers and remote working, recognition of compressed or varying schedules); (ii) training (increased individual training rights, employer obligations for annual training plans); and (iii) mobility (facilitating job switching and redeployment during notice periods). Also, for 2023, the federal government increased the allocation for minimum wages relative to unemployment benefits in the distribution of the “welfare envelope” to promote activation. The measures modernize aspects of employment law, but further efforts are needed to increase the employment rate from 72 percent 17 See Annex VII for an update of implementation of recommendations from the 2017 FSAP.\\n\\nINTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 17\\n\\nBELGIUM\\n\\nto the goal of 80 percent by 2030.18 The tight labor market adds urgency. Efforts should target younger workers and job entrants, older workers, women, workers with an immigration background, and those receiving disability benefits and include more fundamental reforms of wage-setting, hiring and dismissal, employment protection, social benefits, and employer flexibility. Reducing and capping duration of unemployment benefits would provide greater incentives for job search, along with easing the reduction of social benefits when recipients take jobs. Enhancing and speeding accreditation of foreign education and professional qualifications is another area.\\n\\nLabor Force Participation Rate (Percent, 15-64 years, seasonally adjusted)\\n\\n90\\n\\nEU27\\n\\nEA19\\n\\nBEL\\n\\nFRA\\n\\nDEU\\n\\nNLD\\n\\nCHE\\n\\nUSA\\n\\nEmployment Rate by Region and by Gender (Percent, 20-64 years) 100\\n\\n90\\n\\nBelgium Brussels-Capital Region\\n\\nFlemish Region Walloon Region\\n\\n85\\n\\n80\\n\\n70\\n\\n74.9\\n\\n68.3\\n\\n71.6\\n\\n75.8\\n\\n68.4\\n\\n72.1\\n\\n80\\n\\n60\\n\\n75\\n\\n74.8\\n\\n50\\n\\n74.6\\n\\n40\\n\\n70\\n\\n30\\n\\n70.4\\n\\n20\\n\\n65\\n\\n10\\n\\n60\\n\\n2010\\n\\n2012\\n\\n2014\\n\\n2016\\n\\n2018\\n\\n2020\\n\\n2022\\n\\n0\\n\\nMen\\n\\nWomen\\n\\nTotal\\n\\nMen\\n\\nWomen\\n\\nSource: Haver Analytics.\\n\\nSource: Statbel.\\n\\n2021Q4\\n\\n2022Q3\\n\\n24. Continued product-market reforms are also needed to improve productivity and competition and boost growth. Important business environment reforms are underway, including enhancing restructuring and insolvency frameworks, digitalizing the judiciary, and rolling out 5G networks. The federal and regional governments are strengthening cyber-risk monitoring and preparedness throughout the economy. Belgium’s NGEU recovery and resilience plan (RRP) aims at contributing to growth and green-digital transition by focusing resources on mobility, innovation, and support to promising sectors. Belgium must meet 22 milestones before receiving the next NGEU RRP tranche (€847 million); most milestones have been met except budget-neutral pension reforms. Additional efforts should focus on easing entry barriers (particularly retail distribution/services), reducing red tape (particularly for startups), risk capital availability, and improved efficiency of R&D tax incentives.\\n\\n18 Larger increases are needed in Brussels and Wallonia than in Flanders.\\n\\n18\\n\\nINTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND\\n\\nTotal\\n\\nBELGIUM\\n\\nThe Belgian Plan for Recovery and Resilience (In € billion)\\n\\nTotal planned expenses 1/\\n\\nPublic finances\\n\\n0.0\\n\\nFederal\\n\\nCommunities and Regions\\n\\nEconomy of the future and…\\n\\n0.1\\n\\n0.9\\n\\nSocial and coexistence\\n\\n0.8\\n\\nMobility\\n\\n0.4\\n\\n0.9\\n\\nDigital transformation\\n\\n0.4\\n\\n0.4\\n\\nClimate, sustainability and…\\n\\n0.3\\n\\n1.8\\n\\n0.0\\n\\n0.5\\n\\n1.0\\n\\n1.5\\n\\n2.0\\n\\nSources: Belgian National Plan for Recovery and Resilience; and NBB. 1/ Based on initial distribution of €5.9 billion, with projections in climate/green transitio (50 percent), digital transformation (27 percent), and economic/social resilience (23 perce Revised down to €4.5 billion, the government plans to close the €1.4 billion gap from the budget.\\n\\n25. Automatic wage indexation provides relatively timely protection of household purchasing power, but modifications should be considered. As indexation places much of the cost of adjustment to higher prices on employers, it should—in principle—involve less need for government intervention in the event of a price shock. However, indexation may weaken corporate profitability and balance sheets, investment, international competitiveness, and growth. While Belgium’s Wage Law balances indexation with a corrective mechanism to preserve external competitiveness, this may necessitate prolonged periods of limited or no real wage increases following shocks. This may cement labor market rigidities by lessening room for real wage differentiation across sectors or firms according to productivity developments. In addition, government involvement in collective bargaining to facilitate agreement among social partners has been common, often accompanied by costly fiscal incentives. To preserve the benefits of indexation while enhancing long-term viability, the authorities and stakeholders should modify the framework once the present shock has passed. In particular, the health index could be adjusted to exclude additional items—beyond alcohol, tobacco, and motor fuels at present—that are subject to high price volatility from terms of trade shocks and global commodity price swings, with vulnerable groups compensated for purchasing-power losses by well-targeted fiscal support. Moreover, consideration should be given to incorporating productivity trends and a wider set of peer countries when assessing developments in competitiveness under the Wage Law.19\\n\\n26. Reaching ambitious climate goals will require a wider set of initiatives and greater focus on coordination and execution, while taking energy-security challenges into account. Climate policies need to be aligned with more ambitious targets under the EU’s recent Fit-for-55 initiative (47 percent domestic emissions reduction by 2030 for sectors not covered by the EU\\n\\n19 Other reform options include further exclusion of items from the health index, partial or smoothed indexation, indexation (partly or fully) linked to an inflation target, or differentiated indexation, or a lump-sum increase rather than a percentage rise.\\n\\nINTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 19\\n\\nBELGIUM\\n\\nemission trading system).20 EU-identified gaps in the authorities’ current plans—from 2019—include: high transport and building-related emissions; federal-regional differences on targets and policies; the need for more ambitious actions on renewables and energy efficiency; greater attention to subsidies; and limited quantified information on investment needs. Some of these issues have been addressed, including via planned NGEU-RRF investments for building renovation (0.2 percent of GDP), low-carbon energy projects (0.1 percent), and green mobility (0.2 percent). But more needs to be done in policy updates and implementation. Recent EU measures will help (e.g., new ETS sectors, carbon-border adjustment mechanism). Carbon pricing should be increased as international energy prices fall, especially for sectors outside the EU ETS (transportation, buildings, excluded industrial emissions), with revenue recycling to protect vulnerable households and viable trade-exposed firms.21 Higher carbon pricing should be complemented by sectoral feebates and price floors/ceilings to provide abatement cost certainty needed for investments in low-carbon technology. Other measures include reducing subsidies (fuel cards, commercial diesel, heating oil), rationalizing electricity network fees and levies (to reduce disincentives to use electricity over fossil fuels) and providing targeted social protection with cash rather than energy-based support. Real-time electricity metering and distance and congestion road charging should also be introduced. Complementary non-price reforms should include strengthening federal-regional coordination and burden-sharing and further bolstering climate-related public investment.\\n\\n27. Belgium is a key energy hub in Western Europe, and the authorities took important steps in 2022 to enhance energy security.22 This includes a decision in March to extend operations of two nuclear power stations for ten years and efforts to secure alternative gas supplies via pipelines and LNG deliveries, helping fill storage facilities in the region and increasing electricity generation while nuclear plants in neighboring countries were undergoing maintenance. Significant new investments are being made in offshore windfarms, hydrogen, and other renewable initiatives, including with support from the NGEU RRP. These efforts should continue. Authorities’ Views\\n\\n28. The authorities agreed on the need to further implement decided labor and product market reforms to achieve their ambitious employment targets, improve productivity and competitiveness, and boost growth. They conceded that tight labor markets, especially in Flanders, could become a growth bottleneck and underscored that enhanced mobilization is a key objective. They acknowledged that the structure of social benefits may provide disincentives for job search, but stressed the importance of smoothing the phase-out of support, training, and coaching to promote employment, particularly among disability-benefit recipients and disadvantaged groups. They also noted the complex federal-regional division of competencies in the labor market area and for social benefits—training and activation policies are regional competencies; unemployment benefits are 20 The current plan (2021-30) is based on 40 percent reduction by 2030.\\n\\n21 See accompanying Selected Issues Paper: “Fiscal Policy Options to Accelerate Emissions Reductions in Belgium.” 22 Belgium is an energy hub in that it is the location of a major LNG import terminal, a network of gas pipelines, including to the Netherlands, Norway, and the UK as well as France, Germany, and Luxembourg, and important gas storage facilities. Investments are underway to ensure compatibility with hydrogen and to build substantial additional offshore wind capacity.\\n\\n20\\n\\nINTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND\\n\\nBELGIUM\\n\\nfederal. The authorities took note of targeted views on improving the indexation framework, also noting that building consensus on far-reaching changes would be difficult, especially amid historically-high inflation. They noted that possible prolonged real wage restraint and adverse effects due to Wage Law provisions may be mitigated by future wage hikes in France, Germany, and the Netherlands. The authorities were receptive on the need to advance climate reforms, although they pointed to challenges on carbon pricing and on federal-regional competencies/coordination.\\n\\nSTAFF APPRAISAL\\n\\n29. Belgium’s recovery from the pandemic has slowed with high inflation and tighter financial conditions, while the outlook is marked by significant uncertainty and downside risks. A strong, timely response to higher energy prices, along with indexation eased impacts, and the labor market and financial sector have shown resilience. However, along with slowing activity and high inflation, Belgium faces competitiveness challenges, elevated fiscal deficits and debt, and continuing risks and uncertainty, especially escalation of the war and further spillovers. By contrast, lower energy prices could ease fiscal pressures, and together with progress on reforms, boost confidence.\\n\\n30. Fiscal policy should aim for a tighter stance to complement monetary policy in curbing inflation and to rebuild buffers through a credible medium-term adjustment path. The authorities should pursue multi-year, expenditure-led consolidation from 2023 to support efforts to reduce inflation, ease pressures and vulnerabilities, and begin rebuilding buffers. Adjustment should aim to avoid a larger overall deficit this year, and going forward, to reach the debt-stabilizing deficit level and overall balance. It should focus on rationalization of current spending, which is elevated and where there is room for efficiency gains. Expenditure rationalization should draw on federal and regional spending reviews and focus on energy-support measures, goods and services, and subsidies. Energy support should be better targeted while maintaining price signals; it should remain temporary and limited. Sustained efforts are needed to contain wage-bill, social-benefit, and aging costs (pensions, health) and to improve benefit targeting and incentives. Efficient and productive investment spending at the federal and regional levels should be preserved and increased to mitigate growth impacts and raise medium-term growth. Efforts to initiate tax reforms are welcome. In all these areas, alignment of federal and regional policies and improving coordination, incentives, and burden-sharing will be important. A credible, expenditure-led fiscal consolidation, together with structural reforms to strengthen competitiveness, would improve Belgium’s external position, which on a preliminary assessment is substantially weaker than implied by medium-term fundamentals and desirable policies.\\n\\n31. In a fluid environment, financial sector policies should continue to balance ensuring the adequate provision of credit, preserving resilience, and facilitating deployment of buffers to absorb losses when needed. While comfortable capital cushions are keeping systemic risks at bay, financial intermediaries are challenged by a weakening economy, a cooling housing market, and reemergence of sectoral credit concerns. Exit from long, low-yield environment heightens risks of a disorderly adjustment. In this context, placing a near-term hold on additional macroprudential policy\\n\\nINTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 21\\n\\nBELGIUM\\n\\ntightening has been appropriate. The authorities should remain alert to emerging weaknesses, particularly in real estate given large exposures and among NBFIs, in view of more limited visibility on interlinkages and balance sheet vulnerabilities. Worsening of the macro-financial outlook may call for a further calibration of macroprudential policy towards release of available buffers. Ongoing efforts to gather information to enable more tailored stress testing and policy intervention regarding interest rate, cyber or climate risks are welcome and should continue.\\n\\n32. Further advancing of structural reforms is critical, especially labor and product market actions to enhance flexibility, productivity, and competitiveness. Following important measures taken in 2022, further labor market reforms are needed to facilitate reallocation and meet ambitious employment goals. Efforts should target younger and older workers, women, workers with an immigration background, and those receiving disability benefits. This should include reforms of wage-setting, hiring and dismissal, employment protection, social benefits, and employer flexibility. Coaching and training will also help. Once inflationary pressures subside, options to revise the wage indexation framework should be explored with a review of the indexation basis a possible avenue of reform. Important business environment efforts are underway, including involving the restructuring and insolvency frameworks and investments in mobility and green transition. These should continue, along with actions to strengthen cyber risk monitoring and preparedness.\\n\\n33. Reaching ambitious climate goals will require a wider set of initiatives and greater focus on execution and coordination. National climate policies need to be aligned with more ambitious EU targets, addressing gaps and shortcomings. Higher carbon pricing is needed, especially as international energy prices fall, along with reducing subsidies, introducing feebates, rationalizing electricity fees and levies, and providing social protection in cash rather than energy-based support. Real-time electricity metering and distance and congestion charging should be introduced. Stronger federal-regional coordination and burden-sharing are needed, along with stepped-up climate-related public investment. Belgium is an important energy hub in Western Europe, and important steps have been taken to enhance energy security. Significant new investments are being made in offshore windfarms, hydrogen, and other renewable initiatives. These important efforts should continue.\\n\\n34.

Leverage private sector resources and expertise, coordinate measures across governments, and taper as risks abate. (ST)\\n\\nFiscal support was maintained. Tapering started in late 2021/early 2022, but events were overtaken by spillovers from Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the provision of energy bill support to households. Coordination mechanisms continue to need improvement.\\n\\nAddress recent expansions of social spending through reforms or offsetting adjustments. Consider fundamental reforms of unemployment, pension, and other social benefits, including to contain drift from indexation and real benefit increases. (ST/MT)\\n\\nEvents were overtaken by spillovers from Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the provision of energy bill to households. Reforms to pension benefits have so far focused on gaps (flexible workers, periods of childcare) and not reducing costs.\\n\\nRebuild fiscal space once recovery is secured, with ambitious, well-defined, upfront commitments to boast credibility and place debt on a downward trajectory from 2024.

External Sector Assessment Overall Assessment: On a preliminary basis, the external position in 2022 was substantially weaker than the level implied by medium-term fundamentals and desirable policies. The current account (CA) balance is expected to deteriorate to -4.0 percent of GDP, driven by a swing to deficit in the goods balance due largely to higher fuel imports reflecting price surges and lower vaccine exports. The outlook is highly uncertain, with the CA deficit remaining elevated in the near term due to higher energy prices, before returning to a small deficit in the medium term with easing of price pressures.\\n\\nPotential Policy Responses: In the near term, outlays on energy bill support and other expenses related to spillovers from Russia’s war in Ukraine have delayed fiscal adjustment, which is much needed, given elevated fiscal deficit/debt levels and aging-related spending pressures. Narrowing policy space requires fiscal support measures to be limited, targeted and time-bound, balancing the protection of vulnerable households and viable firms with facilitating resource reallocation to mitigate scarring and with increasing energy efficiency. Policies in the near and medium terms should focus on rebuilding fiscal buffers through a credible, expenditure-led consolidation that also creates space to support green-digital transformation through higher investment. Policies should also focus on strengthening competitiveness by addressing structural challenges, including indexed wage increases, social benefit, labor, and product market reforms and actions to foster green, digital, and inclusive growth. These steps are expected to bring the external position closer in line with medium-term fundamentals and desirable policy settings.\\n\\nForeign Asset and Liability Position and Trajectory\\n\\nBackground. The net international investment position (NIIP) decreased to 58 percent of GDP in 2022Q3 from 64 percent at the end of 2021. The decline was driven by a larger reduction in gross foreign assets in 2022Q3 (down 37 ppt of GDP from 2021) than the decline in gross foreign liabilities (down 31 ppt of GDP). Net portfolio investment, the main component of the positive NIIP, declined to 37 percent of GDP (down 7 ppt of GDP from 2021) reflecting largely valuation changes. Net other investment liabilities rose to a high of 14 percent of GDP in 2022Q3, as cessation of payouts to the Bank of Russia due to sanctions remain as interbank debt. Belgium’s large creditor position is also underpinned by sizable net household financial wealth. Gross foreign assets of the banking sector amounted to 76 percent of GDP at end-2022Q3, well below the pre–GFC peak of more than 200 percent following a decade of consolidation and deleveraging. External public debt—mainly denominated in euros— continued to decline to 55 percent of GDP in 2022Q3 from 68 percent of GDP in 2021, a reversal following a sharp increase in financing needs in 2020 due to the fiscal response to the pandemic and a decline of nominal GDP.\\n\\n2022 (% GDP) Current Account (CA)\\n\\nAssessment. Based on the projected CA deficit and growth paths, the NIIP-to-GDP ratio is expected to decline. The large and positive NIIP and its trajectory do not raise sustainability concerns. Belgium’s large gross international asset and liability positions are elevated by the presence of corporate treasury units, which do not appear to create macro-relevant mismatches. Debt Assets: 147 NIIP: 55 Background. The CA balance averaged 0.3 percent of GDP over 2016-21 and has been on a downward path since a post–GFC peak of 1.4 percent of GDP in 2015. Volatility in the trade and primary income balances is driven in part by sizable operations of multinationals and large revisions. In 2022Q1-Q3, the CA balance swung to a deficit of 2.9 percent of GDP from a surplus of 0.4 percent of GDP (revised) in 2021, driven by a sharp deterioration of the trade balance. Net imports of fuels and related materials nearly doubled to €17 billion (3.1 percent of GDP) in 2022Q1-Q3 from the same period in 2021 reflecting surges in energy prices, accounting for one-fifth of total imports compared to an average of 12 percent in 2021Q1-Q3. Net exports of pharmaceutical products declined by 49 percent y/y to €8.7 billion in 2022Q1-Q3, reflecting a slowdown in shipment of coronavirus vaccines. Income and current transfers balances remained stable at -0.2 percent of GDP in 2022Q1-Q3. The cyclically adjusted CA in 2022 is projected at –2.5 percent of GDP, with a cyclical contribution of -1.5 percent of GDP largely due to the deterioration in the commodity terms of trade (-1.2 percent).\\n\\nGross Assets: 435\\n\\nGross Liab.: 381\\n\\nDebt Liab.: 156\\n\\n2022 (% GDP) Real Exchange Rate\\n\\nAssessment. EBA model preliminary estimates for 2022 yield a CA gap of –5.6 percent of GDP, based on a cyclically-adjusted CA balance of –2.5 percent of GDP, relative to an estimated norm of 3.2 percent of GDP. Adjustment for transitory COVID-19 effects on the CA is 0.1 percent of GDP: -0.3 percent of GDP for travel services (including tourism), and 0.4 percent of GDP for transport (subject to updates as new data become available). This is within a range estimated by IMF staff for the CA gap of between –5.9 and –5.3 percent of GDP, applying the standard error of the CA norm estimated at ±0.3 percent of GDP. The gap suggests that Belgium’s external position is substantially weaker than the level implied by medium-term fundamentals and desirable policies. CA: -4.0 EBA Gap: −5.7 Background. After a cumulative appreciation of the CPI-based REER by 7 percent between end 2015-2021, it depreciated by 0.6 percent in 2022, largely mirroring the depreciation of NEER. In contrast, the ULC-based REER appreciated by 1.5 percent in 2022, or by 10 percent since the tough in February 2020, reflecting relatively higher wage increases in Belgium.\\n\\nCycl. Adj. CA: -2.5\\n\\nEBA Norm: 3.2\\n\\nCOVID-19 Adj. 0.1\\n\\nOther Adj.: –\\n\\nStaff Gap: –5.6\\n\\nAssessment. The IMF staff assesses the REER gap, based on the staff-assessed CA gap range, to be overvalued in the range of 7.2 to 8.0 percent, with a midpoint of 7.6 percent (applying an estimated elasticity of the CA balance to the REER of 0.74). EBA model estimates point to a REER overvaluation of 12.6 to 25.6 percent, based on the CPI-based REER index and level models.\\n\\nCapital and Financial Accounts: Flows and Policy Measures\\n\\nBackground. Gross financial outflows and inflows were on an upward trend prior to the global financial crisis as banks expanded their cross-border operations. These flows have shrunk considerably and become more volatile as banks have deleveraged. Short-term external debt accounted for 32 percent of gross external debt in 2022Q3. The capital account is open.\\n\\nAssessment. Belgium remains exposed to financial market risks, but the structure of financial flows does not point to specific vulnerabilities. The large and positive NIIP reduces the vulnerabilities associated with high external public debt.\\n\\nFX Intervention and Reserves Level\\n\\nBackground.

Under staff’s baseline, general government structural deficits remain elevated over the medium term, driven by recent structural spending increases and higher outlays on aging-related and other benefits.1 The primary deficit remains well above its debt-stabilizing level—by 2.9 ppts of GDP in 2027—and gross debt is on a high and rising trajectory (20 ppts above the pre-pandemic baseline by 2027).2 Belgium’s elevated and increasing medium- term primary deficit makes it an outlier among high-debt euro area countries. Interest expenses are expected to increase with rising yields, although costs are partly shielded by the long maturity of outstanding debt.3 Public finances are vulnerable to a credit-and- liquidity crisis event. 80\\n\\nGross Debt versus Structural Primary Balance\\n\\n200\\n\\n2022\\n\\n180\\n\\n0\\n\\n6\\n\\n4\\n\\n2\\n\\n0\\n\\n2\\n\\n2. The authorities’ planned adjustment does not stabilize debt. Plans envisage adjustment of 1.4 percent of GDP over 2021-24, including annual fixed (0.2 percent of GDP) and variable components, the latter based on the level and growth of output. Plans were overtaken by events in 2022 (war in Ukraine, energy crisis), stalling consolidation. The 2023-24 budgetary plan incorporates variable effort of about 0.6 percent of GDP in 2023-24.4\\n\\n3. A more ambitious, sustained adjustment is needed. To place debt on a downward path and reach structural balance by 2030 (the previous EU medium-term objective, MTO), staff calls for structural primary adjustment of 0.6 percent of GDP (or more) in 2023 and 0.8 ppts per year (or more) during 2024-30 (Alternative 1), anchored by cyclical and sustainability considerations.5 Additional savings would be needed to facilitate higher investment spending.\\n\\n1 Social benefit costs are projected to increase due to ageing by 1 ppt of GDP in 2022 (vs. 24.5 percent of GDP in 2019), by 3 ppts by 2030, 5.2 ppts by 2049, and 5 ppts by 2070 (Study Committee on Ageing). Covid-19 related structural spending increases involve permanent increases in healthcare and investment triggered by the pandemic.\\n\\n2 The debt stabilizing primary balance is -0.1 percent of GDP, if key variables (real GDP growth, real interest rate, and other identified debt-creating flows) remain at 2027 levels.\\n\\n3 The average duration of federal debt was 10.5 years in October 2022, while the average interest rate was 1.36 percent. The authorities assess refinancing risks at 12 and 60 months of 12.8 percent and 36.4 percent, respectively, against risk limits of 17.5 percent and 42.5 percent for each category (Belgium Debt Agency).\\n\\n4 The variable effort consists of about one-third each in expenditures reduction, additional revenues and miscellaneous items. For 2023-24, the government outlines expenditure measures from the underutilization of the appropriations in healthcare and at ministries and federal organizations; revenue measures from higher excise duties on tobacco, limitation on bank tax deductions, and the abolition of the notional interest deduction; and miscellaneous item from higher-than-expected revenues from the transposition of the e-commerce directive.\\n\\n5 Measuring adjustment in structural primary terms reflects more directly the discretionary effort.\\n\\n36\\n\\nINTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND\\n\\n4\\n\\nBELGIUM\\n\\n4. The size and duration of the proposed adjustment are demanding and will require a comprehensive approach. Belgium has undertaken sustained, large fiscal adjustments in the 1980s and in 1993-2007, both with external policy pressures. Credible and systematic efforts are needed now to rationalize spending, including systematically incorporating spending reviews in budgetary processes, applying strict spending limits, increasing revenues via tax policy and revenue administration reforms, and enhancing growth and employment through decisive structural reforms. Enhancing cooperation and burden sharing among federal, regional, and community governments will be essential for the consolidation effort.\\n\\n5. The proposed adjustment path is more gradual than that implied by a recent IMF Departmental Paper (DP/2022/014), reaching balance in 8 rather than 6 years (with the escape clause still operating in 2023). Reaching balance in 6 years would mean a lower cap for real spending growth (1 percent) and adjustment of more than 1 ppt of GDP per year (Alternative 2). The departmental paper also calls for upgrading of national medium-term fiscal frameworks (MTFF) and fiscal councils (to endorse projections, undertake DSAs, assess fiscal risks, and indicate whether expenditure ceilings and plans are consistent with targets/risks). Both paths involve significant, sustained adjustment to reach the debt-stabilizing and overall balances in a relatively short period.6 IMF Public Debt Projections (Percent of GDP)\\n\\n12\\n\\n60\\n\\n130\\n\\n9\\n\\n6\\n\\n55\\n\\n50\\n\\n125\\n\\n120\\n\\nBaseline Adjustment 1 Adjustment 2 Pre-COVID-19 Baseline\\n\\n128\\n\\n3\\n\\n45\\n\\n115\\n\\n0\\n\\n40\\n\\n110\\n\\n3\\n\\n35\\n\\n30\\n\\n105\\n\\n100\\n\\n103\\n\\n97\\n\\n6\\n\\nOverall balance Revenue (RHS)\\n\\nPrimary balance Expenditure (RHS)\\n\\n25\\n\\n95\\n\\n9\\n\\n1995\\n\\n2000\\n\\n2005\\n\\n2010\\n\\n2015\\n\\n2020\\n\\n20\\n\\n90\\n\\n2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 2024 2025 2026 2027 2028 2029 2030\\n\\nSources: NBB and IMF staff calculations. 1/ Projections for 2022 and 2023.\\n\\nSource: IMF Staff calculations.\\n\\n6 The simulations by the FPB, based on EU proposed Economic Governance Framework of November 2022, suggested broadly similar magnitude of adjustment for Belgium, requiring fiscal adjustment that could reach 4.0 percent of GDP (i.e., 1.0 percent additional adjustment per year) in 4 years, or up to 4.8 percent of GDP (i.e., 0.7 percent additional adjustment per year) in a longer adjustment period of 7 years contingent on proposing reforms and investments aiming at economic growth and debt sustainability. These adjustments are expressed as an increase in the primary balance of the general government compared to a projection under unchanged policies (see FPB January 26, 2023).\\n\\nINTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 37\\n\\nBELGIUM\\n\\nTable IV.1.

Debt Sustainability Analysis\\n\\nPublic debt sustainability risks remain elevated under staff’s baseline scenario, given the rising level of outstanding debt, continuing high primary deficits, and rising interest rates over the medium term. Factors mitigating these risks include an extended maturity profile and a relatively stable domestic (and euro-resident) investor base. The projected medium-term public debt path is sensitive to a real GDP growth shock, a real interest rate shock, and combined shocks.\\n\\n1. Public debt sustainability risks remain high over the medium term. Under the baseline, the public debt-to-GDP ratio is projected to resume an upward trajectory over the medium term, reaching 118 percent by 2027 under broadly unchanged policies, with growth recovering, the negative output gap closing over the medium term, and interest rates gradually rising. This reflects the combined effect of structural spending increases (some linked to COVID-19 measures—higher health-sector wages) and relief for the energy crisis, as well as increasing costs from aging and social benefits. The contribution from the decline in real interest rate as a driver for debt reduction also dissipates from 2024 onward, compared to the most recent DSA analysis. Gross financing needs are expected to increase to 24 percent of GDP in 2023 from 17 percent of GDP in 2022 and remain at elevated levels over the medium term. Refinancing of the debt stock at lower interest rates from 2017 through early 2022 provided a buffer against rising interest rates in the near-term, but less for medium-term interest costs. The projected medium-term public debt path is sensitive to a real GDP growth shock, a real interest rate shock, and combined shocks (macro-fiscal shock, contingent liability shock affecting growth). 25\\n\\n5\\n\\n0\\n\\n5\\n\\n2. Low interest rates and a favorable debt profile have so far mitigated sustainability concerns related to the high debt level. Belgium ranks among high-debt countries in the euro area (debt ratios above 100 percent). Government gross debt increased significantly after 2007, reflecting fiscal stimulus and support to the banking sector. After peaking at 107 percent of GDP in 2014, debt declined to 98 percent in 2019, supported in part by a favorable interest-growth differential. Debt rose to 112 percent of GDP in 2020, due to the sharp increase of the fiscal deficit—to 9 percent of GDP—arising from outlays to mitigate COVID-19 (and lower nominal GDP), before decreasing to 108 percent of GDP in mid-2022. The debt burden has remained manageable, as debt service has declined with lower interest rates. Average 10-year bond yields declined from a peak of 5.6 percent in 2000, turned slightly negative in 2020-21, and have since risen to about 1.7 percent in 2022. The weighted-average maturity of debt increased from 5.5 years in 2009 to 10.5 years at present, while INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 39\\n\\nBELGIUM\\n\\nBELGIUM\\n\\nthe effective interest rate declined by 230 bps to 1.5 percent in 2021. Close to 85 percent of the debt is owed by the federal government and 15 percent by regional governments, all of which is denominated in euros. About 45 percent of debt is held by residents, just below the 5-year average, of which less than half is held by the central bank (increasing over the last 7 years to 20 percent of outstanding debt in 2021). There is scope for remaining needs to be absorbed domestically (or by wider euro-area financial institutions).\\n\\nGross Debt of General Government by Residency and by Holders (In percent of total) 140\\n\\nCentral Bank\\n\\nOther monetary financial institutions\\n\\n120\\n\\nOther financial institutions\\n\\nOther residents\\n\\nNonresidents\\n\\nDebt Ratio (Percent of GDP, RHS)\\n\\n100\\n\\n80\\n\\n60\\n\\n40\\n\\n20\\n\\n0\\n\\n2000 2002 2004 2006 2008 2010 2012 2014 2016 2018 2020\\n\\nSource: Haver Analytics. 1/ Debt held by residents are grouped under the central bank, other monetary financial institutions, other financial institutions, and other residents.\\n\\n3. An increase in debt-servicing costs over the medium term adds to challenges of fiscal and debt sustainability. Higher borrowing costs will place strains on public finances at a time when fiscal resources are stretched. Belgium’s 10-year bond yield rose to 3.2 percent at end-2022, the highest since mid-2012. Risk premia, measured by spreads over German yields, have averaged 56 bps in 2022, up from 30 bps on average in 2021, and may increase further if the government shows limited capacity to reduce deficits and debt via fiscal consolidation or to enact growth-enhancing structural reforms. The effective interest rate is projected to rise by close to 1 percentage point over 2023-27 to about 2.4 percent, adding further to the budgetary cost. Baseline Scenario and Realism of Projections\\n\\n4. The debt ratio will increase over the medium term under current policies and continued primary deficits, moderate growth, and rising real interest rates. More specifically:\\n\\nMacroeconomic assumptions. Growth is projected to slow to 3.0 percent in 2022, 0.2 percent in 2023, and 1.2 percent (potential) over the medium term. Inflation picked up sharply in 2022 and is expected to decline gradually and stabilize at just below 2 percent in the medium term.\\n\\n\\n\\nFiscal assumptions. The baseline assumes current policies, with the overall fiscal deficit remaining elevated at 4.8 percent of GDP in 2022 and widening further to 5.4 percent of GDP in 2023, due mainly to energy relief measures. Aging and social-benefit pressures will keep the deficit elevated in the medium term. The structural deficit moves in step with headline deficits given the small or closed output gap. The primary deficit remains elevated at 2½ percent of GDP in 2027, well-above its debt-stabilizing level of 0.1 percent and the pre-crisis projection of 1.4 percent (2025).\\n\\nDebt levels and gross financing needs (GFN). General government debt is projected to have decreased to 107 percent of GDP in 2022, before increasing to 121 percent of GDP in the medium term. Long-term interest rates (benchmark 10-year bond yield) are projected to increase to 3.4 percent (average) in 2027, a rise of 160 bps from 2022 (average), an important departure from the previous period when low interest rates allowed for maturing debt to be refinanced at\\n\\n40\\n\\nINTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND\\n\\n180\\n\\n160\\n\\n140\\n\\n120\\n\\n100\\n\\n80\\n\\n60\\n\\n40\\n\\n20\\n\\n0\\n\\nBELGIUM\\n\\nlower rates. The effective rate will gradually rise to 2.4 percent in 2027, an increase of 84 bps, from the historical low of 1.5 percent in 2022. GFN average 19 percent of GDP over the projection horizon.\\n\\nRealism of baseline assumptions. The median forecast error for real GDP growth is close to\\n\\nzero (0.06 percent), while those for the primary balance (-0.69 percent), and inflation (-0.15 percent) are relatively small, measured over the period 2013–21.\\n\\nHeat map. Risks from the debt level are high, with the 85 percent threshold breached under all\\n\\nscenarios. GFN are below the benchmark of 20 percent of GDP under the baseline but exceed the benchmark under specific shocks. The external financing requirement of 77 percent of GDP in 2021 is significantly above the upper threshold, and the share of debt held by non-residents is relatively high at 55 percent of total.1\\n\\nB.\\n\\nStress Tests\\n\\nGrowth shock. Real GDP growth is reduced by one standard deviation in 2023-24 (measured over 2011-20, 2.2 percentage points each year relative to the baseline scenario). The assumed decline in growth leads to lower inflation (0.25 percentage points per 1 percentage point decrease in GDP growth). Under this scenario, the increase in the debt-to-GDP ratio reaches 11 ppts in 2024 and remains broadly constant thereafter.\\n\\n\\n\\nInterest rate shock. This shock involves implications for debt sustainability of an increase in interest rates by 314 basis points (calibrated on the difference between the maximum real effective interest rate observed in 2012-22 and the average over the projection horizon) starting in 2023. The debt-to-GDP ratio reaches 122 percent of GDP (+2.5 percent) in 2027. Gross financing needs are 2.5 percentage points of GDP higher in 2027 relative to the baseline.\\n\\nExchange rate shock. This shock assumes 13 percent depreciation in the real exchange rate in\\n\\n2022, but has no material effect as virtually all debt is denominated in euro.\\n\\nPrimary balance shock. This shock examines the implications of a revenue shock and a rise of interest rates leading to a cumulative 0.4 percentage points of GDP deterioration in the primary balance (one standard deviation: measured over 2011-20) in 2023-24. This shock leads to a modest increase in the debt-to-GDP ratio to 120 percent of GDP in 2027 (+2.7 ppts).\\n\\nCombined macro-fiscal scenario. This shock aggregates shocks to real growth, the interest rate, the exchange rate, and the primary balance while avoiding double-counting effects of individual shocks, debt and GFN reach 135 percent (+17.0) and 23 percent (+4.3) of GDP in 2027.\\n\\nContingent liability shock. In this shock, non-interest expenditures in 2023 increase by the\\n\\nequivalent of 10 percent of banking sector assets, and growth slows by 1 standard deviation for two years (2023-24). Debt increases to 124 percent of GDP in 2027.\\n\\n1 Belgium has one of the strongest net international investment positions in the euro area, and a substantial portion of the external financing needs of non-financial corporations stems from intragroup lending.\\n\\nINTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 41\\n\\nBELGIUM\\n\\nFigure V.1.

Belgian households are relatively highly exposed to gas—mainly from Norway and the Netherlands—with a quick pass-through of price changes.1 The authorities have provided several rounds of timely, somewhat targeted, and timebound (until March 2023 in most cases) support to help households cope with higher energy bills (table). More recently, measures have been considered to help businesses deal with higher energy prices. Expansion of social energy tariffs\\n\\n2. provided targeted support to the most vulnerable, already covered by existing social safety programs. A basic energy package provided gas and electricity vouchers to lower- and middle-income households in the winter months. Some degree of targeting was achieved through an income tax surcharge or “claw-back” for top-income earners. Some measures, such as reduction of the VAT rate on gas and electricity from 21 to 6 percent and lowering of excise duties for petrol and diesel provided quick purchasing power protection but were not targeted and did not incorporate price signals to reduce consumption. 0\\n\\n2. provided targeted support to the most vulnerable, already covered by existing social safety programs.

GDP for 2022-23, somewhat higher than the average for Europe. About two-thirds of the measures were untargeted and four-fifths were price distortionary. Given existing cost- of-living safeguards via wage and benefit indexation, it is important to limit the cost of energy support measures and to better target aid to the most vulnerable 20– 40 percent of households. Moving to cash transfers or block pricing based on a discount for a basic consumption level would help retain price signals, facilitate savings, and cut costs. Support to firms should be targeted to viable, energy- intensive sectors, capped, and linked to actions to reduce energy consumption. 2.5\\n\\nFiscal costs of energy measures for households and businesses reached 2.3 percent of\\n\\nFiscal Costs of Support Measures for Households, 2022-23 (Percent of 2021 GDP)\\n\\n4.0\\n\\n1 Natural gas accounted for 30 percent of gross electricity production and 80 percent of gross heat production in Belgium; direct exposure to Russia is limited to 4-6 percent of gas imports.\\n\\nINTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 47\\n\\nBELGIUM\\n\\nTable VI.1.

Main Recommendations from the 2017 FSAP: Follow-up\\n\\nThe authorities have continued to follow up on recommendations from the 2017 FSAP, including on: systemic risk analysis, including stress testing, and monitoring of non-bank financial institutions; prudential policy, supervision and oversight, including macroprudential tools and implementation; on the financial safety net and crisis management. On AML/CFT, recommendations have already been implemented. A new FSAP was launched in late 2022.\\n\\nRecommendation\\n\\nTiming*\\n\\nStatus\\n\\nSystemic Risk Analysis Enhance the risk analytical framework by: (i) incorporating bank stress testing into the toolkit for systemic risk assessment and macroprudential policy. (ii) extending the horizon of insurance stress tests. (iii) intensifying monitoring of insurers’ mortgage loan portfolios and related underwriting standards. (iv) in cooperation with the FSMA, further developing the shadow banking monitoring framework. (v) enhancing the coverage and quality of commercial real estate (CRE) data. (NBB)\\n\\nST\\n\\n(i) In 2021, the NBB undertook a full top-down stress test for Belgian LSIs and, in 2021 and 2022, a top- down NII stress tests for Belgian SIs and LSIs in “low for long” and “high” interest rate environments. In 2022, the NBB also redeveloped a top-down credit risk tool for all Belgian banks (incl. subsidiaries). (ii) In the 2021 EIOPA and 2021 and 2022 NBB stress tests, the concept of reactive management actions was introduced, a first step into the development of a multi-period scenario. A fully-fledged multi-period stress test scenario has yet to be put into practice at national and European level. (iii) No new actions taken.

Belgium participates in a\\n\\ncurrency union (EMU) with 19 other members of the EU and has no separate legal tender. The euro, the common currency, floats freely and independently against other currencies. Belgium has accepted the obligations under Article VIII, Section 2(a), 3, and 4 of the IMF’s Articles of Agreement, and maintains an exchange system free of multiple currency practices and restrictions on the making of payment and transfers for current international transactions, except for restrictions maintained solely for security reasons, which have been notified to the Fund pursuant to Executive Board Decision No. 144-(52/51).\\n\\nLast Article IV Consultation:\\n\\nThe last Article IV consultation was concluded on September 8, 2021. The Executive Board assessment and the staff report (IMF Country Report No. 21/209) are available at link. Belgium is on the standard 12-month consultation cycle.\\n\\nCapacity Development (CD)\\n\\nBelgium has received direct IMF technical assistance since the last Article IV consultation in two areas—through a review of tax policy analysis and proposals that were utilized in a tax reform blueprint issued by the Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister in July 2022 and in support for analysis of gaps in revenue collections under Belgium’s value-added tax.\\n\\nBelgium is an important financial supporter of IMF externally-financed capacity development (technical assistance and training), including country-specific and regional projects as well as IMF multi-partner CD vehicles (regional and thematic trust funds and CD centers). Belgium has also been a financial supporter of other IMF initiatives, including for low-income countries via the Poverty Reduction and Growth Trust and for debt relief.\\n\\nFinancial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) Participation:\\n\\nBelgium: Financial System Stability Assessment\\n\\nIMF Country Report No. 18/67\\n\\nSummary: The FSAP conducted in late 2017 concluded that the Belgian financial sector has become more resilient as a result of structural changes experienced since the global financial crisis, but is facing growing vulnerabilities, mostly in the form of risky mortgages. Nonetheless, banks and insurance companies remain capable of absorbing credit, sovereign, and market losses in the event of a severe deterioration in macro financial conditions. To contain rising mortgage-related risks, macroprudential policies recently proposed by the NBB should be enacted promptly. Other risks, including banks’ capacity to cope with interest rate shocks, credit risk vulnerabilities in selected portfolios, and growing liquidity risk in insurance companies, should be monitored closely.\\n\\nFinancial sector supervision and crisis management arrangements have been upgraded markedly. However, the transition to a full banking union must be carefully managed by national and\\n\\nINTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND\\n\\n3\\n\\nBELGIUM\\n\\nEuropean authorities given the presence in Belgium of large subsidiaries of euro area banks. Sufficient capital and loss absorbing capacity should be kept in these subsidiaries to ensure the viability of group resolution strategies. The NBB and European authorities should continue ongoing efforts to upgrade their supervisory and crisis management frameworks and operational capacity, including by prioritizing the resolution planning for important banks and strengthening the deposit insurance system. It will also be important to address the challenges posed by complex financial conglomerates, ongoing changes in the risk profile of the insurance sector, and potential challenges arising from the low quality of some insurers’ capital.\\n\\nThe oversight arrangement for the Belgium-based Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (SWIFT) has proven effective but is being challenged by new risks. To strengthen the NBB's ability to exercise its role as overseer and protect Belgium's reputation as a key hub for financial market infrastructures, the authorities should consider complementing the NBB’s use of moral suasion with regulatory and supervisory powers and should enhance the NBB’s ability to share information with foreign authorities.\\n\\nThe next FSAP assessment was launched with a scoping mission in late 2022 and will be aligned\\n\\nwith the 2023 Article IV consultation cycle with Belgium.\\n\\nAnti-Money Laundering/Combating the Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT):\\n\\nBelgium underwent a mutual evaluation of its AML/CFT regime by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) in 2015. The FATF 2015 report noted that Belgium has the core elements of a sound AML/CFT regime, although some elements are not yet fully in line with the 2012 FATF Recommendations. Following the adoption of the mutual evaluation report, Belgium was placed in enhanced follow-up process. The latest report in September 2018 (third enhanced follow-up) noted Belgium’s progress in strengthening its framework to tackle money laundering and terrorist financing since the mutual evaluation. However, efforts need to continue to fully implement the FATF Standard, including Recommendations 13 and 14 on corresponding banking, and money and value transfer services.\\n\\n4\\n\\nINTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND\\n\\nBELGIUM\\n\\nSTATISTICAL ISSUES\\n\\nAs of January 31, 2023\\n\\nI. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance\\n\\nGeneral. Belgium’s economic and financial statistics are adequate for surveillance purposes. The National Bank of Belgium (NBB) regularly publishes a full range of economic and financial data and provides calendar dates of main statistical releases.\\n\\nNational Accounts. Belgium adopted the European System of Integrated Economic Accounts 2010 (ESA 2010) in 2014. Revisions of national accounts were released in September 2014 to comply with EUROSTAT requirements to provide national accounts statistics in ESA 2010. The NBB is responsible for compiling the national accounts statistics. Quarterly accounts are published within a lag of three months. Both annual and quarterly accounts data are of good quality, with shortcomings mainly related to export and import deflators, which are based on unit values rather than prices collected directly from exporters and importers.\\n\\nPrice Statistics. A consumer price index and industrial producer price index are compiled according to best practices and published monthly. Producer price indexes for services activities are disseminated quarterly.\\n\\nGovernment Finance Statistics. Belgium compiles and publishes a complete set of general government accounts on an accrual basis (ESA 2010). The NBB publishes annual and quarterly data on general government revenue, expenditure, and net lending/borrowing; transactions in financial assets and liabilities and a financial balance sheet data; and details on the consolidated gross debt.\\n\\nMonetary and Financial Statistics. Monetary and financial statistics data are available in standardized report forms - SRF 1SR for central bank, SRF 2SR for other depository corporations. The data are disseminated on a monthly basis through the International Financial Statistics. The NBB also reports data on some key series of the Financial Access Survey (FAS), including mobile and internet banking information.\\n\\nFinancial Sector Surveillance. Belgium reports financial soundness indicators (FSIs) to STA on a quarterly frequency, including 16 core FSIs and eight encouraged FSIs for deposit takers, and nine encouraged FSIs for other sectors.\\n\\nII. Data Standards and Quality\\n\\nBelgium adheres to the IMF’s Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS) Plus since January 26, 2023, and publishes the data on its National Summary Data Page.

They broadly concur with the thrust of staff's analysis. While economic conditions have been challenging in 2022, the Belgian authorities have taken decisive actions to maintain citizens’ purchasing power, the country’s energy security, and to protect the vulnerable from the consequences of the energy crisis. Efforts are underway to further implement structural reforms and the authorities are committed to consolidate public finances in the coming years.\\n\\nRecent data point to somewhat better economic outcomes than previously expected. In its most recent forecast for 2023, the European Commission projects growth at 0.8%, 0.6 percentage points higher than staff, and revised the inflation forecast down to 4.3%. The economy also held up better in 2022 than previously expected, confirmed by staff’s 2022 growth forecast of 3%. GDP grew by 0.1% in the final quarter of 2022, hence avoiding a recession. Job creation has been strong in 2022, with employment growth at 1.8 %. Consumer and business confidence has also recovered in recent months, from a low point in mid-2022.\\n\\nFiscal policy – towards a consolidation of public finances\\n\\nBased on the latest estimates, the budget deficit for 2022 is likely to be smaller than previously estimated. According to preliminary estimates by the State Secretary for the Budget, the 2022 budget deficit will amount to around to 4% of GDP. This better-than-expected outcome is driven by both higher income and less spending than previously planned, in line with the somewhat stronger economic data.\\n\\nBelgium is fully committed to reducing its government deficit in the years to come to a level that puts debt on a sustainable declining path. A budgetary review for 2023-24 will be conducted in March 2023, in order to reassess the budgetary strategy. The authorities will take stock of the recent revenue and expenditure developments and the macroeconomic outlook, both of which are cautiously on the upside. In doing so, they will continue to balanc e the need to ensure fiscal sustainability without jeopardizing the recovery of economic activity . In the medium term, t he outc omes of the spending reviews will be instrumental in identifying structural efficienc y g ains alongside further deficit reducing policy changes , including pension and labor market reforms.\\n\\nIn a context of rising interest rates worldwide and with the ECB's net asset purchases having been discontinued, Belgian government securities continue to generate sustained market interest. As staff rightly points out, the debt management strategy has contributed to strengthening market confidence. Also, in response to market demand, the Belgian Debt Agency has lengthened maturities during the period of low interest rates, thereby reducing refinancing risks. The average maturity is now more than 10 years, with an average implicit interest rate at 1.5%.\\n\\nThe objective to lower the deficit is shared among the different government layers in Belgium. The selected issues paper on fiscal federalism points to the specific structure of the Belgian federal state and rightly notes the need to coordinate between the different entities. All levels of government in Belgium share the responsibility to ensure the sustainability of public finances. T he COVID-19 cris is, Russia's war in\\n\\nUkraine, and specific factors such as the floods that hit the Walloon Region in 2021, resulted in a debt increase for all levels of government. They will all make consolidation efforts in line with the European Framework.\\n\\nThe authorities have narrowed the focus of their energy measures and are taking steps to target support further. After broad-scale support measures at the beginning of the energy crisis, Belgium has gradually shifted to more targeted and more limited support measures. Under the so-called “basic energy package”, a bill reduction on electricity and gas during the winter period, the financial support received is subject to income tax, meaning a larger portion is recouped from higher-income households. In February 2023, the Belgian federal government took a further step by keeping the VAT on gas and electricity at 6 percent for residential contracts and offsetting its budgetary impact by introducing excise duties on gas and electricity from April on. The level of these excise duties will depend on international energy prices and will be consumption-driven, with higher consumption being subject to higher duties. Furthermore, stricter eligibility criteria will also reduce the number of people benefiting from a reduced social tariff.\\n\\nThe authorities wish to thank IMF staff for their effective engagement on tax issues throughout 2022. The IMF has assisted Belgian authorities in calculating the VAT collection gap. The results of this analysis will feed into the administration’s work, focusing on the areas where gaps are pronounced. In addition, the IMF’s input has been actively used in the drafting of a tax reform blueprint prepared by the Minister of Finance. In the coming period, a first package of proposals will be brought to the table. The IMF’s support will help guide work on tax reforms in the coming years.\\n\\nFinancial sector – strong buffers, but close vigilance is warranted\\n\\nThe Belgian financial sector remains in a strong financial position and is well positioned to support the real economy. Financial institutions have so far adapted well to the new environment of geopolitical fragmentation, asset price corrections, high inflation, rising interest rates and less favorable growth prospects. Non-bank financial intermediation was resilient in 2022, supported by prudent risk management. Financial sector firms maintained strong buffers, with Tier 1 capital in the banking sector at 17.1% and a solvency rate in the insurance sector at 227%. This enables them to absorb possible unexpected losses, without impairing their functions vis-à-vis the real economy.\\n\\nThe authorities agree with staff on the need to preserve resilience and ensure adequate provision of credit. Given the signs of a downward turning point in the financial and credit cycles, the reactivation of the countercyclical capital buffer has been postponed, to ensure that banks can use their ample capital reserves. In view of potential vulnerabilities, macroprudential measures for mortgages were maintained. Macroprudential expectations continue to discipline the mortgage lending conditions at origination. Price growth in the housing market has slowed in 2022, yet prices continued to grow in nominal terms. The housing market in Belgium has historically been stable compared to peers, inter alia avoiding a pronounced drop in prices during the global financial crisis. Risks linked to higher interest rates are in addition mitigated, as more than 70% of mortgages carry a fixed interest rate for the whole maturity of the loan. If vulnerabilities nonetheless were to materialize, a sectoral systemic risk buffer has been put in place, corresponding to €2 billion, to finance losses or solutions for borrowers facing repayment problems. The National Bank of Belgium has also increased its focus on the prevention of money laundering and terrorist financing, with a comprehensive action plan in which higher risk in certain sectors is accompanied by heightened vigilance and inspection.\\n\\n2\\n\\nAuthorities are looking forward to the IMF’s Financial Sector Assessment Program for Belgium, which will be carried out mainly in 2023. A first scoping mission took place at the end of 2022, with two additional missions later this year. Belgium attaches great importance to financial surveillance by the IMF, including in its own jurisdiction. The authorities are working closely with staff. As during previous occasions, they will carefully consider the findings and act on the recommendations of the assessment.\\n\\nStructural policies – continued commitment to long-term reforms\\n\\nThe federal government and the subnational levels of government are committed to increase the employment rate. The federal government has set an employment rate target of 80% by 2030. To meet this target, Belgium is working to both reduce the number of unemployed, and to increase overall labor market participation. In 2022, Belgium intensified its back-to-work policy, with more coaching and financial enticements to bring currently inactive people to the labor market. The authorities expect to reap the benefits of this policy in the coming years. Employment efforts are furthermore tailored to the needs of the different regions, with a focus on increasing overall employment rates in Brussels and Wallonia and addressing labor market bottlenecks in Flanders.\\n\\nPolicy reforms are being further implemented to support growth and improve the sustainability of public finances in the longer term. The federal government is currently discussing the pension policy. Reforms to the pension system will enable the unlocking of resources from the EU’s Recovery and Resilience Facility, which in turn allows for investments underpinning Belgium’s long-term growth potential\\n\\nThe authorities note that automatic wage indexation has been helpful in protecting purchasing power in Belgium and buttressing consumer confidence. Indexation is furthermore not expected to lead to inflation higher than the EU average in the period 2022-23. The indexation mechanism is coupled with a wage law, which ensures that wages do not deviate on a structural basis from neighboring countries, as indicated in the staff’s analysis. The authorities aim to preserve the benefits of wage indexation while being mindful of drawbacks for the economy. Together with trade unions and employers, the authorities will continue to monitor the functioning of the automatic indexation.\\n\\nBelgium is working towards meeting the net-zero by 2050 objective, including by moving away from fossil fuels towards electrification of energy consumption. Efforts are ongoing to electrify heating and transport, as well as reducing overall energy consumption. The selected issues paper on accelerating emissions reductions provides useful input into meeting Belgium’s objectives. Besides examining price- based policies, the authorities are increasing investments to address climate change. An agreement has furthermore been reached in January 2023 to extend the operations of certain nuclear reactors by ten years. This will help bolster energy security and affordability in the uncertain times ahead.\\n\\nThe Belgian authorities look forward to a continuation of the productive interaction with Fund staff.\\n\\n3\", metadata={'source': '/root/workspace/data/DOCs/PDF/Belgium_2022.pdf'})]"
